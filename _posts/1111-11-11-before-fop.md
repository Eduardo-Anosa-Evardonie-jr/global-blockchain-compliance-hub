### Pre-FOP

Trip planning for all leaders begins at Pre-FOP, about five days before the first-years arrive. Pre-FOP is a busy time for the Steering Committee and leaders alike, so it is important to stay on schedule and make sure that things get done. Time is carefully allotted for WFA review, skills review workshops, food preparations, equipment work, and any troubleshooting.

During your free time it is important that you and your co-leader get to know each other and establish your shared expectations for the trip. This is the time when you plan your route and review/discuss all relevant information, so that you are fully prepared to lead. Together, you should "inventory" your skills, both technical and interpersonal, so that you can address strengths and areas of possible improvement in your leadership styles. Make sure you're where you're supposed to be when you're supposed to be there, but find time with your co to set goals and prepare for the unexpected.

#### Co-Leader Inventory
    
These questions have been designed to help you get to know the person you'll be spending the next 10 days with. By answering these questions, you and your co can work towards answering this larger question: *how will you work to create a safe, fun, respectful, and supportive learning environment for your FOPpers and for each other? As you think about your co-leading relationship, be sure to review the co-leading section. Thoughtful discussion on these issues now will help to prepare for the days in the field. Remember, the more time you spend getting to know your co now, the fewer problems you'll have on trail!

##### The Basics Inventory

1. What do you do for fun?
2. Do you consider yourself a morning person or a night owl?
3. What's your favorite day of the week? Why?

5. What's something you're really proud of?
6. What has your Harvard experience been like?
7. What do you remember about the beginning of your first year here?
8. Why did you decide to become a FOP leader?
        
##### Skills Inventory

The following questions should guide you in talking about areas of strengths and weaknesses with your co. Discuss how comfortable you feel with these skills and, where appropriate, think about how you might teach them to your FOPpers. All leaders should feel comfortable with all of these skills.

#### Co-Leader Perspectives Inventory

This is an opportunity for you and your co(s) to talk about your own identities and belief sets. We hope that this conversation can inform and guide your co- or tri-leading relationship as you take a diverse set of FOPpers into the woods together. 

- Are you used to being in communities with people of varying socioeconomic backgrounds? What do we need to be aware of so we can help create a trip culture that is welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their background?
- Are you used to being in communities with people of differing religious beliefs? What do we need to be aware of so we can help create a trip culture that recognizes the validity of all individuals' religious beliefs?
- What knowledge do you have about mental health concerns and about the resources available at Harvard?
- When you are talking about the subject of significant others, what words do you tend to use? How actively should we work to make space for a variety of sexual orientations?
- What is your perspective on race relations at Harvard? If you think there is a way of improving race relations at Harvard, how can we help foster that on our trip?
- What kind of gender roles, if any, would we like our co-leading relationship to model?
- What are your views on the social scene at Harvard including social organizations like Final Clubs or Greek organizations? Do you plan on including a discussion of the social environment at Harvard on your trip?
- What knowledge do you have about eating concerns? What might alert you to a potential eating concern, and how should we plan on addressing a potential eating concern on and or after our trip?
- How do you plan on creating an atmosphere of inclusiveness for your FOP group? What steps will you take towards creating a safe space in which FOPpers can express feelings, thoughts and opinions without feeling excluded or discounted?
- What will you do to maintain, extend, and transfer this safe space once your trip returns to campus?
- FOPpers come from a wide variety of backgrounds. What does this mean for your goal of establishing a positive group dynamic?  
- What plan do you have for addressing possible conflicts that might arise out of differences in background between your FOPpers?
- How might you, as a co- or tri-leading group, model celebrating *difference* on your trip?  

#### Goal-Setting for Trips

##### Outdoor Education

FOP's main goal is to provide a fun and challenging outdoor orientation experience for incoming first-years. Although FOP is not a professional outdoor program, it is our responsibility to teach students enough basic outdoor skills to keep them healthy and happy. It is a good idea to talk with your co-leaders about what sorts of skills FOPpers should be learning on your trip, and how these skills will be learned. Keep in mind that over 3/4 of FOPpers have little or no experience in the outdoors, so what may be obvious to you may be new and strange to them.

Some skills can be imparted more or less by example or by diffusion, while others may require more conscious attention. Work out with your co who will do what with the group. Some division of labor among co-leaders is valuable. However, it is crucial that every leader be capable of showing and teaching any basic skill: Know your stuff!

With regard to things like tarps, stoves, and cooking, it's important that everyone learns as much as possible about all aspects of the trip, rather than simply letting a few super-competent people carry the whole group. (It's easy to slide into the latter situation, but not much is gained when everyone deals only with that in which he or she is already proficient.)

##### Orientation

At the heart of the FOP program is the goal of orienting first-years to college life at Harvard. Leaders should think through the concerns and anticipations they felt when beginning their first-year. Many students have not visited the campus and will feel nervous both about being away from home and about the transition into Harvard. So, beyond managing the risks of the group and teaching about the outdoors, it is also your responsibility as leaders to facilitate this transition.

Many questions about Harvard life will be answered informally on the trip. Below is a guideline of other possible topics to discuss with first-years:

- The formal advising system at Harvard (Peer Advising Fellows and Department/ House advisors). Also, using other students, TF's, and faculty within a department to supplement the formal system.
- Classes: How shopping period works, core classes, any good suggestions of first semester classes.
- Activities and Sports: The range of options, time commitments, and the chance to try new activities at college.
- Support systems: Where help is available for personal and academic crises, such as UHS, Bureau of Study Counsel, peer counseling groups, advisors, proctors, peers, TF's.
- Places to buy food, clothes, and supplies in the Square and beyond.
- All the other stellar insights you can share as a Harvard veteran.

#### Trip Planning and Preparations

##### Route Planning

As co-leaders, a couple of decisions have already been made for you: where you're going, and whom you're bringing with you. As you try to figure out how to get from Point A to Point B, consider the following issues:

- What is the relative level of experience of your FOPpers? Are you leading a "B" trip with FOPpers who lean toward "C," or who might like an "A" trip better? Remember that the FOPpers will probably have less experience than you, and you don't want to compromise the rewards of FOP by placing unrealistic demands on your group.
- What do old leaders have to say about the trip? Look at past route evaluations; these can be invaluable in avoiding dangerous stream crossings or trails with very little water, or in finding the perfect lunch spot on Day 3 or an opportunity to do some stargazing.
- Other resources are available in the FOP office, including AMC Trail Guides with helpful details, measurements, and other info not necessarily on the maps.

After selecting a route you will fill out a route itinerary form. It is critical that the completed route plan is legible and detailed; it is an important piece of information both for you and base camp in case of an emergency. It should be detailed enough to follow if the map is lost! An SC member or basecamp will meet with each co-leading pair to review the itinerary once it is completed. If it is not detailed enough it will have to be redone, so it makes sense to fill it out carefully the first time.

##### Other Preparations

After you have selected a route, spend some time going over your FOPpers' paperwork. Make sure you know about any special medical situations in advance; but also try to get a feel for their personalities and anticipate any situations that might come up. Plan what kind of games you'll play on the first night; plan also some surprises for those grueling days when you'll need them most (for example, jolly ranchers, brownies, candy necklaces, instant s'mores (use fluff!) or pineapple). Finally, you should plan out the first 24 hours of your trip (see below, 24 Hour Plan) and make sure you cover all the topics they may need to know to live in the woods for a week.

##### Trip Advising Meetings

During Pre-FOP, a Trip Advisor will meet with each co-leading pair. In the meeting, the advisor will go over your goals for the trip, review your route itinerary form, give you any specifics about your route, and answer questions. If you have questions or concerns about the trip this might be a good time to express them.

### The First Meeting with FOPpers

*"Because You Never Get a Second Chance to Make a First Impression."*

When you finally meet your group it is your responsibility to keep them together during that first night in Cambridge. This can be accomplished in many ways, and the following are just examples of some things that have worked in the past:

- Give them a common link to help bonding, such as same-color bandannas, stickers, or necklaces. This can help foster a feeling of security and belonging. A FOPper may feel like he or she is that one admissions mistake, different from the rest of the students. It can be very frightening to arrive in Cambridge, and some FOPpers are very insecure and vulnerable.
- Note: Although we encourage unifying devices, keep them on a small scale in Cambridge. We want all the groups to feel as though they are going to have a great time, and if some groups have extravagant gimmicks, others might get discouraged. Don't spend much money at all on these!
- Play some FOP games. A good one to start with is the animal name game. Another good game is to have them all pair up and then introduce each other to the group. Mingle and the human knot can be a little touchy-feely for some people, but they do bring the group together and get it cooperating. Use your judgment; if people seem really uncomfortable, skip these games until later.
- The first night is probably not a great time to play word games. Some people simply aren't good at these and end up feeling really stupid. If you want to play these, perhaps wait until everyone has established him/herself and is a little more secure.
- Take them out for a snack or something. This act can be as simple as buying a half-gallon of ice cream at 7-Eleven or CVS, but it gives them a chance to form some initial bonds, to find some common ground to talk about. It also allows you to start to get a sense of who they are (as a group and as individuals) before you spend five days on the trail with them. Keep in mind that not all FOPpers are able to spend the money on this sort of thing - it might be best to buy the snack yourself and bring it to the group.
- Have a slumber party the first night. (But keep the emphasis on the "slumber"!) Some groups enjoy sleeping en masse from the start. The time on the trail will seem awfully short and this allows time for that sleeping bag chatter which cements groups. Sometimes it is easier to express fears when you can't really see who you are talking to and hearing that other people have the same problems can take away the loneliness. It can be good for leaders to share their own fears, within certain limits (e.g., it is not a good idea or very confidence-building to tell them you are scared to death about leading this trip...) - if you can relate to them any fears you had when entering as a first-year student, you may become more real and more human in their eyes.

### The 24 Hour Plan

You and your co will want to cover this list with each other before you talk to your FOPpers. Plan out when you will talk about certain issues, and who will talk in each situation. From the very first night, the manner in which you talk about such issues as hygiene and minimum impact will set the tone for the rest of your trip. Many of these topics are addressed throughout the handbook.

#### On Campus

- Medical concerns: Find out if anyone's medical history has changed or if they're taking any medication during the trip. Ask your FOPpers how they are feeling physically that day.
- The route: Get them psyched to hike (and to listen to your long, boring talk to follow); some may still feel a little tentative. Hand out copies of the map if you've got them.
- Effective packing: Men should organize weight toward the upper middle of the back, while women should concentrate weight toward the hips.
- Clothing and equipment: Have the FOPpers take everything out of their packs, or perhaps demonstrate with a volunteer how to prioritize packing so that raingear and water are always accessible, etc. At the same time, you can make sure everyone has everything they need so there will be no last-minute surprises.
- Hygiene and feminine issues: We don't need to tell you this, but remember to be sensitive. Sometimes it puts people more at ease to have the male leader introduce this subject by creating the understanding that no one needs to be embarrassed. Leave time to run to CVS.
- Group gear: Discuss all the pieces of group gear, and then try to divvy them up fairly.
- Group food: If you haven't done so already, mix the GORP with your group - this can be a fun experience. Discuss the general FOP menu and try to split up the food evenly, cautioning FOPpers to keep lunch food handy, to try not to crush food if possible, and please please PLEASE to keep fuel away from granola!
- Eating concerns: Let FOPpers know that eating on FOP is critical for their warmth and safety. We burn a lot of calories and FOP is not the time to diet. Set the right tone - "mmm, I love all of this cheese since I get so hungry on the trail." If a FOPper has a real problem with the food, let the SC or the Director know, since some adjustments in the menu can be made.
- Strangers: See policy. Especially important for service and front country trips.
- Group dynamics: Stress the importance of working together and creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and tolerance. Introduce "No Discount" and the Full Value Contract.
- Safety issues: Make them aware of general safety issues, such as staying with the group, and of program policies regarding drugs and alcohol, romance on FOP, etc. This is your opportunity to set the tone of being firm on safety issues. Emphasize that the wilderness is an isolated environment and that behavior that might be okay in their backyards (like jumping off rocks or horsing around) is not safe when you're hours from civilization.
- Accident issues: Explain to your FOPpers the expectations of them during an emergency situation. Explain "Universal Precautions" (see Part VII, Wilderness First Aid) and warn them to never attempt to help out with a first aid situation unless directed by a trained rescuer. We want to ensure that no one in FOP has an exposure to any blood borne pathogens.

#### At the Trailhead

- Pack adjustment: Make sure everyone's pack is properly fit. It'll be a long trip otherwise.
- Footcare: Instruct FOPpers to monitor themselves for hotspots and teach them about the wonders of moleskin.
- Hypothermia: Explain how important it is to stay dry, and talk about layering, using raingear before you are wet, symptoms of hypothermia, etc. 

### Fancy Shmancy Tricks of the Trade

(Straight from the book of Sir Coleman Carter.)

Things you may consider bringing on your trip:

- Jolly Ranchers: FOPpers enjoy the surprise of candy AND according to peeps in the medical know, their mild laxative qualities "encourage" long-distance phone calls. 
- High and low bag treats: Pros and cons to sharing that you have them; discuss those with your Co(s) but definitely take them. Also, consider not calling them high and low bags, but instead, "awesome" bag(s), to avoid such stark delineations of things on the trip.
- A frisbee!:  You can use it as a plate AND you will have something cool for the FOPpers in a big open area (like on beaches for Switch).
- A Crazy-Creek type chair: Taking care of yourself makes you a more effective leader for the whole trip because you can think about the FOPpers rather than how uncomfortable you are. 
- A secret stash of candy just for you and your co, always eat a little when you get into camp.
- Extra water bottles: Comes in handy when a FOPper  reveals that he/she ran out of water three hours ago.
- A lil' keychain compass: Because navigating's fun!
- A copy of the relevant part of your map on 8.5 x 11 paper stored in a ziploc bag. Bonus points if you highlight the trails you plan to use.
- Extra socks for peace of mind if nothing else.
- A tiny container of Vaseline: Soothes your dry skin and works well as a stove repair lubricant. 
- A packet of "Wet Ones" wipes: Because sometimes it's nice to feel a tiny bit clean.
- A nail clipper: Because packing packs tends to lead to hangnails and everyone will be grateful for relief from those.
