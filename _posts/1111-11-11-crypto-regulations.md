While we recognize that we cannot ensure safety on our trips, risk management is at all times the highest priority of Harvard FOP. This means that FOP leaders are expected to manage the group environment by adhering to and modeling safe procedures, teaching sound and cautious principles, and ensuring that these principles are followed. At the most basic level our objectives related to risk management are simply:

- To prevent fatalities, disabling injuries and serious illness, and to reduce the rate of other accidents, injuries and illnesses
- To provide an emotionally safe environment that ensures respect for all participants and leaders

Because of the educational nature of FOP, leaders should integrate learning about risks and managing uncertainty into every aspect of the FOPpers' learning experiences. This responsibility begins from the first moment the FOPpers arrive at Harvard. Activities that involve risk require prudence and care in their undertaking. Risk management is not merely following correct practices; it is also an attitude to be carried into every part of a program. Unless this attitude pervades the entire program, it will be impossible to provide high-quality outdoor orientation. The following are general FOP safety and administrative practices which apply to all ability levels and activities:

- Risk management policies established by FOP apply regardless of the skill level of the participants
- Written policies provide a basic foundation for actions; conditions may warrant more restrictive practices
- Any departure from specific risk management policies must only be in emergency situations to enhance safety, and must involve a carefully developed, rational, and defensible plan

### Accident Prevention

An important element of risk management is the ability of a leader to maintain a "what if" attitude toward all aspects of the FOP experience. Group safety in unexpected situations depends heavily upon the judgment of leaders. Judgment often consists of assessing the intangible "complex set of dynamics" that make up an intuition or feeling. Be aware that many, many errors in judgment result from blindly following a schedule even when conditions indicate a need to change plans and/or from deferring to others despite one's own concerns. Don't be rigid about schedules, and don't ignore your own (or your co-leader's) misgivings about a certain situation. Remember that the "margin of safety" on our program must be greater than what you or others individually might settle for on a trip of your own. When in doubt, take the conservative course of action.

#### Why Do Accidents Happen?

An accident is "an unplanned, potentially dangerous occurrence that results in injury, property damage, or a close call (near miss)."

[Jed Williamson][williamson presentation] researched when, why, and how accidents in the outdoors occur. From his information he has suggested that we think about the potential for accidents as arising from three different categories:

- Unsafe conditions (loose or falling object, weather)
- Unsafe acts (hiking too slowly or too fast, improper clothing/equipment)
- Errors in judgment (failure to deal with a new or unexpected situation, sticking to a schedule when situation dictates you should change it)

#### The Accident Equation

In this model, potentials for causing accidents are called hazards. There are two types of hazards: environmental hazards and human factor hazards. The potential for an accident occurs when the two hazards overlap. You will always have some overlap because the environmental factor always exists. The goal is to minimize the area of overlap, where accidents occur.

##### Human Hazards

- Participants: poor skills, fatigue, trying to "prove oneself," no awareness of environmental hazards
- Leaders: poor judgment regarding safety, lack of knowledge of environmental hazards, poor teaching abilities

##### Environmental Hazards

- Rocky trails, bad water, exposed ledges, weather
- Equipment-related hazards: improper clothing, faulty stoves, inoperative equipment

***H + E = Accidents*** is one simple paradigm to consider risk; other folks have developed similar models based up the assessment of variables.

#### Risk Management and Gambling

One way to conceptualize risk is to think of your decisions as playing into a giant slot machine. Slot machines will give out different rewards based upon the way the "numbers turn up" on the windows. The lemon is a loser. Most slot machine playing may be able to tolerate a lemon here and there, but when the slot machine comes up all lemons  you lose.

When on a trip, many human and environmental factors create lemons. If it is 45 degrees and raining, the environment is providing the most likely situation for hypothermia, this is one lemon. If you get out of camp late, add another lemon. You may have to enter into a ravine where an evacuation is difficult or timely if there is an accident, add another lemon. The attitude of group members, the fatigue of instructors, etc. all provide risks that may add up to a great loss.

Decisions in the wilderness are gambles. The woods are full of risks and your job is to make good bets  or good decisions. Looking at the lemons carefully can give you a sense of the odds of your bet. A decision to push ahead to camp, when you have lemons such as nightfall, bad attitudes, dehydration, group conflict, and hunger  all point to a disaster waiting to occur. This is a poor bet, yet leaders will sometimes play high-stakes to try to make sure things turn out the way they want. The need to push through sometimes works, but sometimes does not. Not working out can ruin many previous gains, so evaluate thoughtfully.

Remember to stop and chat with your co-leader. Pick out the lemons and consider your bet. Good leadership is working to put the odds in FOP's favor.

### A Model for Educational Risk Taking, Beyond H + E = A

(From the research of Brent J. Bell and Preston Cline.)

Although the HEA model of Williamson covers broad categories, a more complex model for managing risk is needed that incorporates the many facets of risk beyond the physical. Overall, risk taking is a type of behavior essential to being  we are never without risk and therefore, risk is too large of concept to manage comprehensively, but we can employ structures in which to consider risks. The model for educational risk begins with management.

The beginning stage of management is recognizing variables (like the lemons in the previous model). Only after the variable is identified can learning about it occur. In this sense, management is the conclusion of a progression of identification of risk, analysis of the risks involved (involving reflection, research, and history of results). Management is the development of a structure or system to control, influence or accept risks.

- Identify
- Analyze
- Manage

Secondly, humans are complex, consisting of numerous variables and vulnerabilities. People are vulnerable beyond physical health. When someone has broken a leg and is bleeding, they will often worry more about how they look in front of others (social loss, fear of other people's opinions) than be singularly concerned with being injured. The numerous concerns of individuals complicate risk management, and the various concerns tend to be exponentially additive, not simply summed in a linear manner. If you are going to take a physical risk, such as skiing, you have increased your risk of getting injured physically while also increasing other risks such as financial loss and social loss.

Thirdly, when an outdoor program operates by putting people at risk, it must have a clear understanding of why a participant is out in the woods. You cannot answer the question "is the risk worth taking?" in the affirmative without a conception of the purpose. Risk taking for no reason is not programmatically viable.

Risk management is a process of developing a purpose or goal for risk taking, identifying and analyzing the variables with the understanding that elimination of risk is not a possible outcome of management.

One more important point needs to be made here, and that concerns the dependency upon judgment as the sine qua non of risk management. It is logical that outdoor leaders who have the ability to make good decisions will be able to manage risk more effectively than leaders who do not have good judgment, but judgment in many of the situations outdoor leaders come across is a finite resource. A person can only consider and make judgments on so many things at once. At a certain point a leader reaches a point called task saturation. Task saturation comes from a person doing too many things at once. If I am driving on the highway, talking on my cell phone, eating my McDonald's meal, while merging into traffic  I may be task saturated. At my present level of tasks I may be able to function, but when one more task is added (a car stops in front of me) I may not have the ability to respond to the new task without giving up on other tasks (goodbye McDonald's meal and cell phone call). Task saturation effects the ability to make clear judgments. What we hope leaders develop through training is good habits. Habits allow for some simple tasks to feel natural. When crossing the street, I do not stop to consider how to cross the road, I have a habit  I look for traffic without even thinking barely conscious of my action.

Outdoor leaders need to have habits. A leader with good habits will have the ability or opportunity to consider different types of risk beyond the physical realm. If I can set up camp without thinking much about it, I am free to think about the social dynamic of the group and consider deeper ideas than how to tie the bowline.

### Risk and its General Types

Risk for outdoor programs tend to focus on physical loss, but ignores or lightly touches upon the important areas of emotional, cognitive, and spiritual risks inherent in many outdoor education programs. This is not just a problem with outdoor education, but with contemporary North American education in general.

Physical loss is important, and it is understandable why the profession came to focus on keeping people physically safe in the wilderness. Certainly emotional and cognitive risks are less important than loss of life. In fact, a "hierarchy of needs" exists with risk. Physical risk must be managed first and foremost. Most spiritual, cognitive, and emotional risks can be recovered from, especially those within the general guidelines of an outdoor education trip, but people can not recover from death. Once a person physically dies, growth, education and future learning are extinguished. Still, risk is important beyond the physical element because risk is essential to learning and development.

When Kurt Hahn developed Outward Bound he used the definition of risk meaning "to venture into uncertainty." The nautical term "Outward Bound" was meant to symbolize a venturing out into an educational experience. Hahn was not looking at risk as a thing to be eliminated but rather embraced. This is why we (Preston Cline and Brent Bell) propose to develop a model for risk that is educational in focus, a model identifying the fact that experiential education depends upon risk as part of its educational impact. Risk management is not about eliminating risk to the point where students cannot fail, this only creates inauthentic situations where the very power and nature of educational experience has been changed to "entertainment." True education needs to go beyond vicarious reading of information and entertainment to the risky endeavor of changing people, of constructing new meaning, and of dealing with authentic situations.

In dealing with the social factors that effect risk, leaders need to be aware of the power of some human and social factors that effect management.

### Risk Homeostasis

An important concept put forth by Gerald Wilde is one of risk homeostasis. Wilde emphasizes the fact that people have a certain amount of risk that they are willing to take at any given time. It works like a thermostat in the sense that once a person sets their risk-o-stat, they will adjust behavior to be in line with the amount of risk a person optimally operates at in a variety of situations. This theory explains numerous phenomenon, such as the fact that as cars get safer, accident rates remain the same (because people will drive them faster to keep a similar level of risk) or as a person's comfort and expertise with a situation increases, they will tend to take greater risks, such as the rock climber who begins by climbing 5.5 climbs and then wants to climb more difficult and riskier climbs.

Wilde believes we all have a target level of risk. The reason for the target level comes from numerous factors, but it is first influenced by cultural ideas of risk. What is considered a reasonable risk in one culture may not be reasonable in another, for instance if I invented a way to beam people to different places like they do on Star Trek, but told you it would result in a death for every x number of uses, you may balk at the cost of life, even if the cost is actually the same as it is for driving in a car - an acceptable risk in our culture.

Risk is influenced by culture in promoting a risk paradigm, but in situations risk is influenced by both the individual and the group perception of risk. Say a group of people all get on a bus and start down the highway. As the driver increased speed, participants on the bus were asked to raise their hand when they began to feel unsafe  as speed increases, more and more hands go up in the air, but all at different times. A general consensus does not exist where everyone feels able to raise there hands in unison, for example at 68 miles an hour. The comfort zone for each person is unique.

The group also provides some influence on risk; actual research shows a lot of subtle influence on individuals risk taking. Two examples of group influence on risk taking are the "Risky Shift" study and "diffusion of responsibility." The risky shift explains a risk taking phenomenon in groups, where the group may rate the risk they are willing to take individually as a number between 1-10. If the group's risk taking preference has a mean of five, the decision the group agrees upon typically will not be five, but either significantly riskier or safer depending upon the group make-up. This risky shift explains how a group can end up taking great risks, even though no individual was comfortable with such a risk level alone. Groups facilitate some type of accentuation of risk.

One explanation for the risky shift among groups is the feeling of diffusion of responsibility. Since a group has more people to spread out the blame, an individual in a group setting will be willing to take on more risk, or feel that the risk really does not involve them. Diffusion of responsibility is at its worst when everyone else thinks someone else is taking responsibility when in face no one is.

Individuals therefore will develop an idea of risk optimization within a few factors (e.g. cultural influences, individual effects, group effects) that will be used to determine an optimal level of risk (the target risk) that creates a risk environment. The risk environment connects with research on performance. The performance stress curve explains Eustress  the positive level of stress. The theory states that people need a certain amount of stress to enhance performance, but only to a level. A person can move from stress that is motivating and helps one to concentrate and accomplish tasks to "distress" which becomes debilitating and results in overload. Risk and stress are parallel concepts in this paradigm, and Wilde's research on risk homeostasis is really a set point for Eustress in an individual.

Therefore when a person is developing a program or a curriculum, they need to look to program the appropriate amount of risk to not only optimize the learning of the individual, but also to set the boundaries to contain the experience within an area of growth, and not harm.

In the risk environment, the individual tries to optimize their interest and needs. It may be about an individual optimizing outcomes, but it also may be about optimizing a social environment, optimizing relationships, or optimizing education. Important to understand is that there is an individual optimal amount of risk which is always greater than zero. No one has an optimal need for absolutely no risk, thus stripping them of humanness.

The risk environment is contained along a spectrum of absolute safety on one end and total loss on the other end, so for physical risk the continuum is between the extremes of immortality on one end of the spectrum and absolute death on the other. In between the extremes exists a set point of optimization for each individual and for each type of risk. Since this is a group experience, the instructors try to contain the risk set points within a smaller container which is the boundaries of the experience. These boundaries are necessary for the proper management of the experience and the ability of the instructors and the group to know what they are getting involved in.

On each continuum the target of risk is contained within broader boundaries. The boundaries are meant to be areas of uncertainty for the experience. Defining these areas allows an instructor to explain to participants on a course roughly what the kinds and types of risks that the course is designed to incorporate and included in that the types of failures. Socially the course may include people getting uncomfortable and even feeling the effects of a groups rejection or cold shoulder, but what is out of bounds may be rejection without any explanation or acts of aggression towards another. This is different from the assumption of participants and many leaders that courses will not have conflict and participants will be protected from emotional struggle. The greatest change in the model is not so much preventing more harm, but rather defining what harm is acceptable. As Keith King often says, "a broken arm on a course is acceptable with me, but a death or broken back is not" (King 1996).

Education needs risk, and risk connotes the chance for loss. Since protection from all loss would make an experience inauthentic, then a certain amount of failure and loss is depended upon by the system.

### Protecting from Loss
In the world of finances, loss is protected by insurance. My car insurance does not keep me from all loss, but protects me from a loss so great I could not recover from it. Loss in educational setting is interesting because recovery from loss may actually be the most educationally beneficial aspect of the experience for a student. However, too much loss could impact both the level of risk a person is willing to take and prevent future learning and growth. If you die on a trip, no growth is going to be possible. Similarly, some losses can overwhelm any benefits included in an experience.

One of the best management tools for risk is the creation of insurance. In outdoor education, many different types of insurances can be developed to help guide the risks participants will take on a trip. The protection and the management of risk work together.

| Type of Risk 	| Protection                     	| Management Strategy                	|
|--------------	|--------------------------------	|------------------------------------	|
| Financial    	| Insurance                      	|                                    	|
| Affective    	| Self-knowledge                 	| Relationships with others          	|
|              	| Self-esteem                    	| Social support                     	|
|              	| Caring                         	| Counseling skills for leaders      	|
| Physical     	| Medical training               	| Promoting healthy behaviors        	|
|              	| Nutrition/health               	| Awareness of environmental dangers 	|
|              	| Screening                      	|                                    	|
| Cognitive    	| Support of the ideas of others 	| Cooperative group discussion       	|
|              	| Research                       	|                                    	|
|              	| Culture that accepts mistakes 	|                                    	|
| Social       	| Cooperative group              	| Set up cooperative group           	|
|              	|                                	| Deal with mistakes and conflict    	|
|              	|                                	| Group Contracts                    	|
| Spiritual    	| Faith community                	|                                    	|

So the work of risk management is to consider a numerous amount of risk variables and place students in an environment where risk is allowed, but management of the risks is accomplished through the thoughtful consideration of the purpose. Managing risk goes beyond the physical, which is helpful to our most physical FOPpers, since we can challenge them in different ways, such as having them take personal and social risks, rather than staying in the environment where they have the most success and the least learning. In all, it is up to the leaders to figure out what they will contain within the already defined bounds of FOP.

### Accountability

Your training process as a FOP leader is designed to enhance the good judgment and common sense that we look for in trainees, so that you are fully prepared to go into the field with a group of students. The handbook is designed to serve as your guide to responsible leadership, and we expect you to follow FOP policies. However, the wilderness is an isolated environment where situations beyond your experience and control can occur. Special circumstances may arise in which reason and judgment dictate that you break with FOP policy. Any departure from specific FOP directions should only be used if it involves a carefully developed, rational, and defensible plan. Accountability translates for FOP leaders into an ongoing commitment to clear, honest communication and a willingness to engage in questioning and evaluation. It is an openness to learn from our mistakes, to take credit for our successes, and, in all cases, to think critically.

Leaders are accountable to the University, to the FOP Director, to the Steering Committee, and to each other. This does not translate into telling each other what to do, but rather into knowing more about each other and being able to share the responsibility with each other. The important point to keep in mind is that the more we talk, the more we give each other feedback; and the more we help each other and combine our strengths, the more effectively we'll be able to manage risks on our trips.

### Emotional Safety

Emotional safety is in some ways a less clearly defined subject than actual physical safety. The perception of one's own physical safety can affect one's emotional safety, however, and a lack of emotional safety can profoundly affect an individual or a group. Maintaining the emotional safety of the group can be much harder than maintaining the group's physical safety  we have the FOPpers' medical records, but there's still a lot we don't know about their histories.

- Be sensitive. You and your co-leader(s) should monitor the group, watching for changes in behavior - subtle or abrupt - that occur in response to events.
- Create a safe, supportive environment for all FOPpers and leaders. Work with your co-leader(s) to make sure everyone is comfortable in the group.
- Give people their space. An encouraging touch on the arm or shoulder might not bother a FOPper, but a back rub could be too much for someone to handle. Don't assume everyone is as comfortable with physical contact as you might be.
- Follow FOP guidelines regarding group dynamics. Look at the policies regarding alcohol, drugs, and sex, and read the section on outdoor leadership.
- Maintain an open and tolerant atmosphere. Remember that FOP aims to foster an open and tolerant atmosphere where people are willing to work with each other regardless of differences such as gender, age, race, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic or socio-economic background.
