### Why is diversity important?

As leaders, diversity is important both as an element of the self-contained context of the trip itself and as an analog for FOPpers' entrance into what, in all likelihood, will be the most diverse community of which they've ever been a part.

FOP conceptualizes diversity as difference among people in their identities and their stories. Indeed, at its core, leading a FOP trip is about entering the woods as 10-14 very diverse individuals and exiting the woods having celebrated this difference.

How might our FOPpers be different from each other? How might we be different from them? How might we be different from our co-leaders? How do these differences allow us to develop our own self-awareness as individuals, and our support system as as group?

These questions are ones that we ask and explore on FOP: in five minute autobiographies; on the trail; through Kick-Ass/Ass-Kicked. Often, directly comparing what we already do to diversity is a matter of framing. For example, after facilitating an early group sharing activity like (M&M's, five minute bios, etc), co-leaders might say: "Sharing our authentic selves with one another can be scary, especially when these authentic selves are all so different. But this difference is what makes our FOP trip - and the community you all are about to enter - so wonderful. If we share and listen openly, this difference becomes a source of strength in ourselves and in each other."

To fully embed a diversity curriculum into FOP - the trips and the program - we must be more explicit about who we are and what we do. The FOP Leader community is - in some ways - quite diverse, but in others, we are homogenous. Most of us are white, many of us grew up backpacking, etc. For a relatively homogenous community to think intentionally about diversity is daunting and uncomfortable. We must lean into discomfort!

To orient our FOPpers to the diverse community of Harvard, we must celebrate the diversity on FOP trips and discuss difference - as it manifests both on our trips and at Harvard.

### How do we talk about diversity?

Here's a simple way to have what can be a high-risk conversation...Toward the end of your trip, raise the question of diversity with FOPpers. Frame it as both a reflective question - How has diversity been a part of our trip?  What has it been like to share so authentically our difference? - and a forward-thinking one - How might this be an analog to the diverse community we are about to enter?

Depending on both your trip vision and your FOPpers' contributions, here leaders might bring out more heavy-handed facilitation. For example: "At Harvard, you will encounter people who are very different from you.  Indeed, you will encounter someone - in your entryway, in class, at a party - who says or does something that will make you upset. You might be inclined to write them off: they don't seem to see the world the way you do. But you will not have had the privilege of spending a week in the woods with that person. In the woods (as you know because you've been on this sweet FOP trip), we become the best and truest versions of ourselves.  We share with each other authentically and we come together in our vulnerability. With every person at Harvard, no matter how different from you they might seem, imagine what it might be like to hear his/her five minute autobiography. Imagine what she might say in Hot Seat. Imagine what they'd say during Fear in a Hat. Even better: don't imagine - find out. We can share authentically and come together in our vulnerability in the front-country, at Harvard. Every person you meet at Harvard - just like every person on this FOP trip - has a story. It is a story that is different from yours, and that is what makes it worth hearing. If you find yourself daunted in the coming weeks or years by the difference between you and your classmates, remember this group: remember how we shared our difference with each other and, in doing so, shared our most authentic and best selves with each other.  Do that at Harvard."
