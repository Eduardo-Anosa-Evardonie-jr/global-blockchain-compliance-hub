It’s a requirement that all FOP trips have at least one conversation focused on issues surrounding diversity, allyship, and marginalization, but hopefully you find ways to build elements of this larger discussion into little moments on the trail and during other activities. 

We know that we don’t have to justify why diversity is important to FOP leaders, but here’s one way you can frame its relevance to FOP’s role as a pre-orientation program. First, if one of our goals is for FOPpers to get to know each other as individuals, we should be making it equally possible for every member to be known. Some people hold identities that are more vulnerable and more difficult to fully express because of how they have been marginalized or ignored in society. Conversations about diversity can provide the framework to allow those students to be known in those aspects that set them apart, instead of forcing them to continue walking the earth invisible as they have so often before been forced to do. Even with a group that seems homogeneous, these conversations are an integral part of their experiences in the world that they might not have had the chance to ponder. It’s one way that they can deepen their knowledge of themselves, too. 

Also, taking a step back, FOP is probably the organization that deeply affects the most first-years before they even begin classes. We have the power to create the campus that we want to be part of.  With great power…

Try not to allow your conversation to be derailed into one about how “we all come from different places but we’re all equally valid.” Don’t let it be dominated by the kid who has lots of worldly ideas after traveling Europe on his gap year, or the kid with trite mottos about how “everyone’s diverse in their own way.” Lean into the conversation about the inequalities, the harder stuff, the way systems of oppression make some of us feel like we should be enemies. 

Knowing that these kinds of conversations can be particularly difficult, we have included here some tips and thoughts about how you might frame them. 

Finally, we know it could be daunting to read this. It was daunting to write, too. We knew there was no hope of being comprehensive, and we were painfully aware that the more we write, the more we are guaranteed to have written something that misses the point, or deserves revision, or is outright wrong. That hesitation is probably familiar to some of you, too. It feels easier sometimes not to say something than to risk being called out. But we hope that you will seek to lean in to that discomfort, as we have tried to. Call us out and keep the conversation going. 

#### Conversation Norms
This isn’t a comprehensive list, but here are a few norms to think about setting for your FOPpers:

  - Recognize that these issues are bigger than ourselves
  - Assume best intentions, but recognize that good intentions are not enough
  - Apologize fully when you are called out (more on that below)
  - Validate emotions, esp. if you don’t fully understand them
  - Validate personal anecdotes
  - Promote self-care, esp. for those who are sharing a lot of themselves

#### Anger (& other emotions)
These kinds of discussions can elicit a wide range of emotions from people, and that can be difficult to deal with. It can be easier if we:
  - Recognize that these issues are bigger than ourselves, and that: 
      - Your comment could be just the tip of the iceberg, or a trigger for some other incident or issue.
      - You could be inadvertently playing into a harmful stereotype or a binary that makes certain identities invisible. 
      - When someone is hurt by an offhand comment you might have made, their hurt could go beyond you and your intentions. 
      - When someone feels like their voice is silenced, it may not be about you as an individual silencing them, but the systematic silencing that they have faced at the hands of the group of privileged individuals that you may belong to.
  - Reverse the narrative:
      - Just as we as a society habitually teach girls to avoid being sexually assaulted, a lot of times we try to create norms that prevent people from calling each other out in ways that might lead to feelings being hurt. But by remembering who the real victims are, we remind ourselves that it’s far more meaningful and to the point to try to teach in the direction of a society where one doesn’t have to fear sexual assault. Similarly, it can be more powerful to teach to a society where people understand that anger and other strong emotions are natural and important to express, and instead where those who are receiving these emotions learn how to handle them productively.

#### Calling Out
As the likely facilitator of many of these discussions, it may sometimes fall upon you to call someone out for a comment, question, attitude, or action that you notice. Awesome! Calling out is a good thing - besides being necessary on individual levels, it also pushes the group’s conversations to go deeper and gives people a chance to revisit and revise some of their harmful assumptions. Hopefully, you’ll be able to norm it in your group, and not have it seem like something unusual or confrontational, definitely not something that would end up requiring VOMPing. Here are some ways to help:
  - Have you and your co-leader(s) casually call each other out and handle it gracefully during one of the first days. (It doesn’t have to be convincingly realistic to do its job!) That exchange could go something like:
      - Co A: I was talking to my friend Emily about how hard she finds it to know how and when to “come out” to her friends as trans*. She was telling me about how hard it is to explain in a way that non-trans* folk can understand. 
      - Co B: Oh, did she feel trapped in the wrong body?
      - Co A: Well, actually, that’s probably not the phrase I’d use. It sort of lumps together all trans* people’s relationships with their bodies, and presents a binary about “right” and “wrong” bodies based on cis/hetero norms. A lot of trans* people feel that they’re much more trapped by society’s norms than by their own bodies. 
      - Co B: Ah gotcha, thanks so much for explaining. 
      - Co A: No prob. *finishes story*
  - Use the “Ouch” / “I’m sorry” framework
      - Basically, you agree to the following rules: 
          - if someone wants to call someone else out, they just say “ouch” 
          - the person who is being called out immediately pauses and says “I’m sorry”
          - then the person who said “ouch” can either choose to talk about it more or just move on
          - there’s no pressure to explain the “ouch” in the heat of the moment
      - You can discuss with your cos whether the “ouch” has to be something personal or not, or if you want another word for less personal “ouches”
      - This can help ease the barrier of anxiety for people who want to speak up when they see something not good but who may not feel comfortable interjecting without a framework
      - It can also keep conversations moving along instead of getting bogged down
      - It puts the power in the person who has gotten the “ouch”
  - Call it “calling in” instead of “calling out”
      - You can introduce this idea as part of your norms. It goes along with the idea that you are all assuming best intentions of each other, and as a result, naming people’s mistakes doesn’t have to be a matter of portraying them as ‘other.’ It can take the sting out of being ‘called out.’ Good quote from Ngọc Loan Trần:
      - “I picture ‘calling in’ as a practice of pulling folks back in who have strayed from us. It means extending to ourselves the reality that we will and do fuck up, we stray, and there will always be a chance for us to return. Calling in as a practice of loving each other enough to allow each other to make mistakes, a practice of loving ourselves enough to know that what we’re trying to do here is a radical unlearning of everything we have been configured to believe is normal.”

#### Apologies
Apologies are not scary! They’re really important and inevitable. When done well, they can allow people to feel comfortable leaning into difficult or uncomfortable discussions.
  - Here is what some bad apologies might sound like: 
      - I’m sorry that/if you were offended…
          - This one is kind of a microaggression, because it implies that the hurt was not necessarily legitimate and that the burden is on the other person to handle their own emotions. It demonstrates an attitude of being closed to further discussion and learning.
      - I meant / I didn’t mean…
          - This shifts the conversation to being about someone’s intentions, when the more meaningful conversation is about the content of what was done or said and what might be problematic about those actions or words in themselves. It’s also another way to wriggle out of responsibility. 
  - Here are the three parts of a good apology:
      - Validate emotions 
          - This can be done implicitly, with body language, or explicitly, with words like, “First off, I wanna validate your emotions”
          - The level of emotion that someone may feel in response to something you said or did can feel really different to the level of seriousness with which you spoke/acted, but that’s not the point. Either way, someone else was hurt, and that hurt may carry a lot of baggage underneath the surface.
      - Acknowledge responsibility
          - Use the words that the other person used/ might have used to describe your words/ action. If they called it insensitive, acknowledge that it was. Period. Not “insensitive to you,” “insensitive to some people,” “insensitive in some aspects.” Insensitive. 
      - Make a commitment to doing better
      - Or ask a question: 
          - Would you be willing to teach me more about the assumptions that underlie what I just said/did?
          - Would you help me understand how I can avoid this in the future?
  - Altogether, here’s an example of a good apology (although it always depends on the situation):
        - Hey, I’m really sorry for what I said. I see now that it was really hurtful and marginalizing of the experiences of people who deal with mental health issues every day. I’ll definitely make sure to avoid using those kinds of phrases in the future, and I’ll call my friends out on it too. Thank you so much for helping me realize this.

#### Framing Tools / Anchors
There are times when it may feel impossible to bring up these discussions organically, and you need a way to explicitly bring up this discussion or at least bring it to the forefront of people’s minds. Here are some ways to do that:
  - Read a quote from this section for everyone to ponder independently, or do some writing about. 
  - Read a quote and share how it sheds new light on your own experiences, or what you might have overlooked about an aspect of your privilege.
  - Say, “I benefit from the structures of privilege in X ways and I shouldn’t be at the center of this conversation. But I do think it’s incredibly important that this conversation happens, and here’s why. (Or here’s how these things affect my life or how I am implicitly part of the problem)”
  - Pre-existing FOP activities can lead to discussions about these topics too, if FOPpers are willing to lean into the more uncomfortable differences between them, and if you prompt them to examine them in more depth. Some good examples are: circle of self, five-minute autobiographies, and hot seat. However, this may not work if you have a relatively homogenous group of FOPpers, and also may put undue pressure on those who consider themselves to be minorities to share their vulnerabilities while others don’t have to take the same level of emotional risk. 
  - Fear in a Hat: You can always plant questions like:
      - How diverse is Harvard?
      - Do you respond to something racist someone says if they’re foreign? Or if you’ve just met them and they’re in your entryway?
      - I’m afraid people will laugh when I tell them about my PGPs. (personal gender pronouns)
  - Go around in a circle and ask each person to try to come up with one privilege in their lives that they think they’ve had that most other people in the group have not had. (This may be difficult - you need mature FOPpers for this one.)
  - Ask everyone to describe the worst injustice they’ve had to deal with in their lives. (Again, could be heavy, and problematic, and triggering. UYJ.)

#### Decentering
Most spaces in our culture are clearly centered around the experiences of a few privileged identities.
For example, here are just a few ways that white experiences are centered every day:
      - European tragedies are more publicized
      - PSAs about issues like child marriage get more attention and outrage if they portray white victims (even though the majority of victims are Asian and African)
      - Minorities are marked as ‘other’ in college admissions processes
      - Books studied in schools are overwhelmingly written by white people about white people
      - Language used by white people is seen as ‘proper’ while the language of other demographics is not
In light of that, how can we reverse the narrative so that we allow those who are normally labeled as ‘other’ to be at the center?
Two ways:
  - Equal sharing of vulnerability
      - The responsibility is usually on those who would be ‘othered’ because of their identities to share their stories and be vulnerable. The burden is also on them to defend why conversations about diversity are important at all. Instead, those who find themselves with some privileged identities should also step forward and be vulnerable - about the ways that they are starting to see their own privilege, or mistakes that they might have made. They should also speak to why diversity is important. Studies have shown that it is white students who gain the most from being taught to consider the experiences of people who are different to them. Students of color gain little because they already do it, every day, from speaking in the language of the white majority or writing essays about white boys at school. A safe space can only be constructed with everyone’s active effort. 
  - Stepping back as the expert
      - Relinquish the idea that everyone’s opinion on issues of marginalization is equally valid. Those who have faced it less, or in different areas, may never be able to truly feel the weight of the marginalization. They can only listen to and learn from those who have direct knowledge. 
      - This is where intersectionality is key - an individual who lives at the intersection of several different marginalized identities has experiences fundamentally different from individuals who inhabit only some of those identities. No one has authority to speak for others’ lives.
      - Those who are normally at the center of most conversations might find it disturbing to no longer be able to contribute as much as they are accustomed to. That’s okay. Teaching your more privileged FOPpers to step back from the center is valuable for them and for the other FOPpers.
