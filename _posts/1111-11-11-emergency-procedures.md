### General Guidelines for Evacuations

The FOP basecamp is designed to provide logistical and emergency support for the program. It can be located within 20 minutes of some trail heads, but as much as 2-3 hours from others; you should know the location of base camp in relation to your route, so that you have a clear idea of travel times in the event of an emergency.

Each FOP leader should have emergency contact information, including phone numbers for base camp (see inside back cover of handbook) and numbers for rangers and rescue personnel in northern New England.

When initiating an evacuation, leaders should create a plan for how they would like to proceed, bearing in mind that basecamp and/or rescue services may not comply with the plan. Walk-outs should be conducted whenever safely possible, because outside rescuers can rarely get there the same day. If self-evacuation is possible (i.e. if you can walk out with the sick or injured FOPper) then you can call base camp to be picked up. A base camp staffer can meet you and bring you either to base camp or to a hospital, depending upon the situation. When necessary, the FOPper can spend the rest of the week in base camp, although it is our hope that most evacuations will be able to return to the field. In the event of severe injuries other forms of evacuation may be employed (e.g. litter carry), but these are less preferable because of the time and risk involved.

Hitchhiking is discouraged as a means of communication with base camp. Please refer to the hitchhiking policies and procedures.

In the event of a death, cover the body and cordon off the surrounding area. Record all significant events with the times they occurred, perhaps putting one person in charge of this duty.

In an emergency, ***remember always*** to bring the following:

- A map, marked with the groups position
- Your leader handbook
- A record of the victims vital signs (also known as the SOAP note)
- The completed Oh Shoot Form
- A copy of the patients medical form
- Other necessary outdoor gear (split, and leave some with the group that stays): food, water treatment, shelter, stoves and cook equipment (including fuel), med kit. It is imperative that you fill out your emergency form carefully and completely. One leader plus two FOPpers should hike out to request help, carrying food, water, extra clothing, and bivouac gear (if necessary.)

### Emotional Evacuations 

It is possible that an evacuation may be necessary in the absence of major physical pain or injury. There is a difference between a disgruntled and homesick FOPper and one with more serious concerns. Try to convince a disgruntled FOPper to stay, but keep in mind more serious issues may exist:

- **Suicidal Ideation**: If a FOPper is verbalizing a wish to commit suicide, either to you or to other FOPpers, that person needs to be taken out of the field.
- **Threatening Behavior**: If an individual presents a risk to other individuals, or to him/ herself, s/he needs to be taken out of the field. This behavior could manifest itself in threatening language or actions.
- **Eating Problems**: Maintaining healthy caloric and water intake is essential in the outdoors. It is necessary not only to retain the energy for rigorous physical activity, but it is also an important part of preventing injuries. Individuals are more susceptible to accidents and hypothermia when their blood sugar is low. Because food and water are so important in the outdoors, an individual who is unwilling to eat the food presents a serious problem. Go over the importance of food in Cambridge and frame it along with other safety guidelines and rules. Continue to emphasize the importance of food in the backcountry and encourage your FOPper to eat. See if you can do anything to adjust to their concerns.

### Missing Person Procedures

We hope that you will never have to deal with this subject, but we want to offer some guidance just in case you do. The following outlines how you should react in the case of a lost FOPper.

***React quickly*** if someone is missing. Hold the group up and send at least three people, including a leader, back a ways. If someone is lost, time is working against you. Disoriented people can cover a surprising amount of ground, usually in a direction that will only make things worse.

What to do if someone is lost:

1. Shout the persons name, or use whistles in an attempt to get a response.
2. Get out a map and try to figure out where the person might be after calling has failed. Try to recall where and when the person was last seen, as well as what he or she was wearing. Is there a pond or mountain summit nearby? Two or three people should go as a group to check that place. They should bring a map and a compass and agree to return by a certain time if they have no luck.
3. It is critical not to let anyone else get lost. Don't send people scurrying wildly in every direction. People should scout away from the group only for designated amount of time (ex: 10 minutes).
4. During the wait, keep the group together and calm. Make hot drinks, eat some food, begin setting up camp if necessary.
5. After one hour of searching, notify basecamp.
6. If you do not have sufficient cellular service to communicate with Base Camp, send a leader and two FOPpers out a designated evacuation route to make contact. They should bring a map marked with the groups location, a compass, food, and stuff for an overnight (depending on the time of day and distance). The remaining group should stay put. Both groups should yell or whistle from time to time. If the lost person wanders back, follow a plan agreed upon with those who walked out for help.

#### Ways to avoid losing people in the first place!

While in Cambridge, you should inform your FOPpers what to do in case they get lost:

- Stay put! Advise them to avoid their natural desire to move around. Staying in one location makes it much easier to find them. They should stay put until they are found.
- Try to attract attention. Make noise (yelling, whistling), tie brightly-colored clothing in noticeable locations nearby, etc.

Many individuals get lost when they go to the bathroom at night. Make sure your FOPpers let you know when they are going to the bathroom and suggest going out into the woods in pairs. Other suggestions:

- Before leaving Cambridge, make photocopies of your trail map and give them to FOPpers make sure they know how to read them and where they are going. Also, the Harvard Police gives out free whistles, so you may want to stop by during Pre-FOP and grab some for your FOPpers.
- Keep people together.
- Use the buddy system.
- Maintain voice and visual contact with the hikers in front of you and behind you.
- Always have a leader at or near the back of the group.
- Never pass a trail junction without getting the group together.

All members should always maintain visual contact with the rest of the group. Do not allow people to hike or canoe far ahead. It is simply too easy for people to get lost once a group is separated. Also, if an emergency occurs while the group is split up, it is vastly more difficult to deal with the situation.

### Media Procedures

In the event of a serious emergency, the director is responsible for notifying the FDO, which in turn will notify the appropriate Harvard authorities. Leaders will refer all questions to the Harvard Office of Public Affairs and Communication. Do not engage in speculation with anyone, not even each other.

No one should release any information that identifies responsibility for an accident. All questions will be handled by Harvard Authorities. Specific problems arise when:
- An assessment of fault or a criticism of conduct, of FOP policy or of equipment is made public without a full explanation of the circumstances of the accident.
- Information regarding the nature of the inquiry or illness is released prior to diagnosis by a licensed medical physician.
- Names of victims are released prior to notification of next of kin.

When dealing with an emergency, it is vital that information is transferred promptly, accurately and completely to Base Camp, and it is advisable for all parties to keep a record of communications.

Remember: In the event of an emergency, Harvard's resources will be called upon to support you. Let Harvard communicate with the outside world, and focus on doing what is best for you and your group.

### Notification Protocols

In order to facilitate communication, FOP uses a "stoplight" system to convey the urgency of phone calls. The words "green light", "yellow light", or "red light" should be the first things you say when contacting basecamp. Use the following chart to help you decide which light is appropriate, but don't dwell over gray areas - this is, after all, just a communication tool.

|        		|   Situation Stable? 	| Held Needed in < 24 Hours? 	|
|   ----------------	|  -------------------	|----------------------------	|
|	Green 	 	|       Yes            	| 	No                     	|
| 	Yellow         	| 	Yes            	| 	Yes                    	|
| 	Red    		|	No             	|       YES!!                  	|

Whenever you contact basecamp, you should prepare a plan for what you would like to happen. What will help resolve your current issue? How will the contact affect the trip logistics? Is the request feasible? (Basecamp will try to give you what you request, although occasionally circumstances will dictate that alternate plans are discussed.)
When you are ready to initiate contact, follow these steps:

#### 1. Send a text

Using the numbers in the Emergency Call Guide in your leader packet, start by sending a text. (Texting will often work even when there is insufficient cellular coverage for a voice call.) Use the following structure:

***Light. Name. Trip #. Location. Situation. Time until you will call.***

For example: Green light. Ammar and Grace. Trip 84. On Tchou Tr on Mt Morange, 1 mi from Murray Tr jxn. Need to reroute - uncrossable stream. Will call in 15 min.

#### 2. Place a call

Again using the numbers in the Emergency Call Guide, call basecamp at the time you specified. Work your way down the phone numbers in the order specified until you make contact with someone.

#### 3. If it is a red light situation and you cannot call basecamp, activate the PLB

Look on the Emergency Call Guide and in the policies and procedures section for more information. This is a last-resort device, for use only in life or limb situations.

### Mandatory Notifications

The following events must be immediately reported to Base Camp:

- An evacuation for any reason.
- An accident or illness resulting in a FOPper or leader being in a critical or serious condition.
- An unanticipated lack of contact with a person lasting more than one hour.
- A sexual or physical assault.
- An accident or illness resulting in death.
- Alcohol or drugs found in possession of FOPper.

### Mandatory Evacuations

The following are situations in which an evacuation is considered mandatory. Begin an evacuation even if you cannot communicate with basecamp.

- Anyone who has received CPR
- Spinal cord injury
- Shock victim
- Hypothermia in which the person lost consciousness or was placed in a hypowrap
- Priority injuries (to the head, face, chest, abdomen, femur, pelvis)
- Strains or sprains under the following conditions:
	- Those that require RICE treatment for more than one day
	- If the patient limps while hiking because of the strain or sprain
	- If patient slows pace of the group to a degree that jeopardizes the rest of the group
	- If the patient continually needs to take ibuprofen in order to hike.
	- If the patient has to drastically lighten their load
- Dislocations and fractures

	- Any burn (first, second, or third degree) on the face or hands
- Heat stroke
- Anaphylaxis/any EPI-PEN or Twinject injection

In addition to the mandatory medical evacuations listed above, the following non-medical situations should also be considered mandatory evacuations:

- Emotional problems that are severe enough that they put person, leaders, or group in danger
- Eating concerns that are severe enough that they put person, leaders, or group in danger
- Suicidal ideations
- A FOP group without epinephrine (lost, broken, or used EPI-PEN/Twinject)
- Any sexual harassment or sexual assault that compromises the physical or emotional safety of an individual or the group
