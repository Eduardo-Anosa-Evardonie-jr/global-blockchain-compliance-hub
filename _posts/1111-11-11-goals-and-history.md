### Mission Statement

FOP's mission is to provide group adventure-based experiences that promote the development of social support and self-awareness for first-year students, and leadership development for members of the Harvard community.

FOP should be a resource and support system throughout freshman year. FOP also maintains the following as central values:

- Compassion
- The equality and intrinsic worth of all people regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation, religion, ethnic or socio-economic background
- Responsibility to community
- Care and responsibility to the environment.

Dean Henry Moses first conceived of having an outdoor orientation program at Harvard, and (with the work of Cate Huisman and the early leaders) FOP first offered trips for some 49 students in 1979. Each of the eight subsequent directors (Jeff Smith, Vic Henningsen, Steve Whisnant, John Duvivier, Sharon Bassett, Beth Bellman, Brent Bell, Jessica Ross and current director Paul "Coz" Teplitz) has added his or her own unique vision to the FOP program. The basic premise, however, has always been that the wilderness is a unique learning environment, providing a setting in which incoming first-years can interact with one another, acquaint themselves with Harvard with the help of the leaders and make the transition to college life.

FOP has been well-received. Initial numbers of 200-300 FOPper applications each year swelled in 1996 to a record level of over 600. (Fortunately, the creation of programs like FAP and FUP has allowed more incoming first-years to take part in orientation programs, so our numbers have dropped somewhat since then.) On campus, FOP has attracted increasing interest, and leader applications have soared as well. We hope to satisfy such enthusiasm by offering more trips, though the quality of each and superior risk management have to be our highest priorities.

The types of trips FOP offers also has evolved with time. Initially, hiking and climbing trips were provided. From 1984-1988, bicycling trips were also offered, but due to the added dangers of being on the road and the extra training required to facilitate the experience, they were terminated. Currently, FOP offers traditional backpacking trips, switch trips (half hiking and half canoeing), service trips (with one or two days of trail and campsite maintenance), and observant trips (for religious needs).

FOP is run by its Steering Committee, a group that includes the director and several undergraduates. The SC is responsible for selecting and training new leaders, planning and organizing the trips, and running the office during the year. Members of the SC also serve as resources for the FOP community and act as ambassadors of FOP to the university. The Committee makes decisions by a process of consensus, rather than majority rule, to ensure that everyone is treated with respect and that all members have a voice in the decision process. FOP operates under the aegis of the Freshmen Dean's Office.

Our main goals for the hundreds of FOPpers are as follows:

- Improve the transition from high school to Harvard
- Make friends with fellow first-years and upperclassmen who can support and encourage each other
- Learn about cooperation, initiative, and endurance in a wilderness setting, leading to insights which may transfer to life at Harvard
- Develop a sense of community and a positive connection with Harvard as a whole (including a commitment to public service)

We expect that leaders and FOPpers will find many ways to realize these goals during and after the trips. In fact, one of your most important jobs as a leader (second only to managing risks on your trip) is to impart these goals to your FOPpers. Many additional goals can also be cited for FOP, including: increasing self-confidence; assuming responsibility for oneself and one's choices; improving communication skills; developing toleration and respect for individual differences that will continue at Harvard; learning to work well with peers; and increasing your trust of others. Clearly every FOPper will have a uniquely personal experience on FOP, but we hope that many of these goals can be realized to some extent during and after the week in the woods.

FOP is often characterized as "an introduction to Harvard that takes place in the woods," and FOPpers will indeed begin their trip by being introduced to each other and to their leaders. They will have the opportunity to ask many questions of their leaders and hear various tales of Harvard life. We hope that leaders will give a lot of thought to the ups and downs of the first year at Harvard and try to prepare FOPpers in a positive and encouraging way for the opportunities that lie ahead. Try to think broadly both about your own experiences and about those of friends and acquaintances, so that you can give your FOPpers as full and accurate a picture as possible. Yours may be the first presentation to Harvard the FOPpers receive, so be conscious of the way in which you present yourselves, FOP, and Harvard as a whole.

We realize that FOP will often "stretch the comfort zones" of FOPpers. Not only may some FOPpers be unfamiliar with the outdoors, but they also might be anxious about leaving home and embarking on their college careers. As leaders, it is important that you recognize their concerns and help them adjust by making them comfortable and excited about Harvard. Providing a safe and supportive environment will help the FOPpers make the transition to college and will help ensure that they enjoy the trip.
