Paying attention to your surroundings in the wilderness is critical to your group's safety first of all, but it is also worthwhile for the spectacular natural sights you might run across. If FOP were only about meeting people, we could do it in Harvard Yard. The northern New England mountains and forests are rich with life - a trip can only be improved by lifting your eyes away from the trail and practicing your observation techniques for not only the terrain, but also for other aspects of your surroundings. Try exercises like hiking silently or separating each person by 50 feet or so to get a new perspective. Below are some basic natural history background tips and a guide to identifying unique features you might come across during your trip.

### Geology

The mountains of New England were once the world's Himalayas. Several hundred million years ago, the European plate crashed into the North American plate, initiating the orogeny (mountain building event) that created the Green, White, and Appalachian mountains. Vast portions of the plates, composed of igneous rock (solidified molten lava), were upheaved and forced skyward, in a process similar to the current Himalayan orogeny. In the ensuing eons, wind, water, and time have worn down and eroded the rock, producing the present more "rolling" landscape.

New Hampshire is the Granite State, and for good reason. Throughout the streams and mountain-tops of the White Mountains (and in Vermont and Maine as well) you'll find pinkish or gray stone, often coarse-grained with noticeable crystals. Granite is an igneous rock made up of several minerals, quartz (white) and feldspar (pinkish) among them. The finer-grained gray stone of the ridges and peaks is also mostly granite. Grain size simply depends on how quickly the molten rock cooled: in a slow, "intrusive" process, crystals have time to form; in a quick "extrusive" process (usually at the surface), crystals do not have time to form noticeably.

You can often see the mountain-building process frozen in time on exposed ridges, where distinct veins of differently colored or grained rock run through the large formation. These are called dikes (or sills), and were formed during the upheaval process as violent orogeny caused fault lines and cracks in extant rock, into which molten lava flowed and subsequently cooled. Look closely and notice that the edges of these intrusions cooled first, due to the cold surrounding rock-producing finer-grained texture on the edges than in the center of the "stripe".

#### New England Fun Facts

- Bogs occur only in acid soils
- New England has the most variable weather of anywhere in the world
- When using an ax, machete, or other chopping tool on trees or branches, the most effective angle of attack is 45 degrees
- New England gets twice the rainfall as England
- At one point New Hampshire was 80% open and is now 80% wooded

### Flora

New England's forests harbor a multitude of species. What follows is a round up of some of the most common tree species you'll see in the Northern forests of the Green Mountains, White Mountains, and Maine. These forests in which FOP hikes, sometimes called "transition forest" because they represent a region between the deciduous/mixed forests further south and the vast coniferous tracts of Canada, have relatively similar flora and fauna, though they differ significantly from what you'd find in the Berkshires not so far south. Altitude is the main factor in determining which trees are to be found where. In the lowland riparian areas you'll find mostly broadleaf associations of trees like sugar maple, American beech, basswood, and ash. As one moves upwards into valleys and sloping hillsides the birches, hemlocks, and pines become more common, while at highest elevations you'll see spruces, balsam firs, and birches bracing against the wind. Of course, these are not hard and fast distinctions.

You might not guess it, but the forests we hike through have all been logged or cleared for farming at one time. Colonists and their descendants cleared New England's forests, with the exception of some areas in northern Maine and a few isolated tracts in the most inaccessible parts of Vermont and New Hampshire. Good signs of this history are old logging roads running through some areas or crumbling stonewalls once used to both mark property lines and keep sheep in. We are hiking through second-growth forests that have grown back, often with significantly different species associations, in the last hundred years or so. Conifers have replaced broad-leaf forest in many areas; white pines have lost their dominance. And as time passes, different types of trees come to dominate through the process of succession: for example hemlocks, a slow-growing climax tree, will surpass its neighbors; birches, often the first trees to recolonize an area, will diminish.

#### Conifers

Conifers are evergreen trees that keep their needle-like leaves year-round, and can thrive in hard winter areas. Northern forests are dominated by conifers, especially in the higher altitudes where spruce and balsam fir grow - ever more stunted - up to timberline (often in association with birches). Pines are found in a variety of habitats from low-lying areas on up; look for them on rocky ridges with aspens. Hemlocks are frequently found with beech trees, and favor areas near water and on well-drained slopes. Conifer forests often have relatively little undergrowth, because their needles pile up rather than degrading, and create acidic inhospitable soils.

##### White Pine (Pinus strobus)

- Tree Shape: Pines are easily recognized from afar; they have feathery-looking, pagoda-shaped branches with tiers (if the tree has had space to grow)
- Needles: White Pines have bundles of 5 thin, long needles
- Cones: Long (4-8 inch) cones that droop down
- Territory and History: Massively logged for its fine wood all across the N.E. and the Midwest, white pine forests will likely never recover from their decimation at the hands of the British, who coveted the tall straight trunks for masts and angered colonists in 1760s by appropriating all pines over 24 inches in diameter for the Crown.
- Habitat: The White Pine is one of the most rapidly growing northern forest conifers. Thus, although they have unusually slow growth in the seedling stage and slight shade intolerance, they tend to quickly dominate clearings and have a history of reforesting old New England pastures. If you pass a large stand of White Pines it's very possible that that area was relatively recently cleared.
- Identification Trick: The easiest way to discern White Pine from other pines is that is has five needles, the same number as in the word White.
- Red Pine (P. resinosa) have only 2 long needles per bundle and reddish-looking trunks.
- Pitch Pine (P. rigida) have 3 needles per bundle and prickly cones.
    - Identification Trick: Pitch rhymes with a certain word that you want to call this tree when you bump into its needles. The needles also grow in tufts from the trunk.

##### Spruce, White (Picea glauca) and Red (Picea rubens)

- Tree Shape: Regular tiers of flattish branches, with tips turning upwards a bit
- Needles: Spruces have aromatic, distinctly bluish-green short and prickly 4-sided needles that bristle out from the twig in all directions (e.g. not flat like the fir or the hemlock)
- Cones: Elongated, (2 inch-ish) shiny, downward-turned cones
- Identification Trick: Spiky Spruce is the easiest way to describe this tree.
- White Spruce have scaly bark and are also called "skunk spruce" for what some say is its distinct odor when crushed.
- Red Spruce are the predominant spruce in the White Mountains and can be recognized by their furrowed bark. Red Spruce wood was historically used to make musical instruments because of its uniform texture. Its twigs have an orange tint beneath needles (take a step back to see).

![spruce][spruce]

##### Northern Balsam Fir (Abies balsamea)

- Needles: Flattened in one plane with two distinct white lines on the underside. The needles are blunt-tipped (rather than prickly)
- Cones: Come in clusters of erect cones (2-4 inches)
- Habitat: Balsam Firs grow with spruce at higher elevations.
- Identification: Balsam Firs will often have resinous blisters on an otherwise smooth trunk (these ignite quickly in forest fires). Firs have a distinctive aroma because of their resin, which has the same refractive index as glass (did you know fir resin can be used to mount and hold specimens for microscope displays?).

![nbf][nbf]

##### Hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)

- Needles: They look similar to balsam fir, but look for flat needles spiraled around the twig, with a whitish underside and a prominent mid-vein. On the underside of the twigs, look for tiny aborted leaves.
- Cones: Small (less than an inch), solitary, pendulous cones. The bark of the hemlock is distinctively "cinnamon to purplish" in color and is fissured.
- Habitat: Hemlocks are light sensitive and slow growing trees. They favor areas near water and are located most frequently on well-drained slopes. They are found in the "climax" stage of succession, meaning that they grow
in after the saplings of pioneer trees, such as White Pine, cannot compete with their parents. The presence of Hemlock signifies that those trees grew into a fully developed canopy and thus that that stand of forest is fairly old.
- Identification Trick: Hemlocks have what looks like a Hemline underneath their short needles.

![hem][hem]

#### Deciduous Trees

Deciduous trees have broad leaves that they drop come wintertime (but not before giving New England the best fall foliage display in the world!). Generally speaking, they grow at lower altitudes than conifers, but some species, especially birches and aspens, will mix with conifers far up the mountains. Broad distinctions are whether their leaves are compound (like the beech) or single (all others here), and placed alternate one another or opposite each other along twigs.

##### American Beech (Fagus grandifolia)
- Leaves: Alternating, single leaves with a "tooth" at the end of each parallel vein. Beech leaves are translucent and have a papery quality.
- Fruit/nuts: Beechnuts are "bristly" reddish-brown fruit that open in four parts with sharp three-sided nuts on each part. They are a favorite food for birds and mammals (did you know that now-extinct passenger pigeons once relied heavily on beechnuts?).
- Bark: Smooth, bluish-gray bark (may mottle with age due to lichens)
- Habitat: Beeches are slow-growing and highly tolerant of shade, and are thus seen mainly in climax forests, in the company of trees like the maple, yellow birch, or hemlock.
- Identification Trick: Beech leaves have a prickly look to them and the buds of the beechnuts are actually quite pointy, so when you bump into one, you say, "Son of a Beech!"
- Neat Fact: Though the Beech is a deciduous tree, it maintains its leaves in winter.

![ab][ab]

##### Maples (Genus Acer)
- Individual maple species are somewhat difficult to distinguish from one another, but as a Genus they are fairly recognizable.
- Leaves: Maples have distinct, palmately lobed leaves with teeth at the end of each vein and long stalks. Maple leaves have brilliant fall colors.
- Fruit/nut: Maples have winged fruit that spin like helicopter rotors when they fall.

##### Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum)

- On FOP you're sure to see these.
- Leaves: Sugar maple leaves turn brilliant yellow or orange in the fall, and have almost a 90 degree angle between each of the lobes. Sugar maple leaves' edges are smoother than those of the red maple.
- Bark: Mature bark is dark gray with vertical ridges
- Sap: This is the stuff that goes on our pancakes. Did you know it takes about 40 liters of maple sap to make one liter of maple syrup?
- Habitat: Sugar Maples are tend to have strong root systems and tend to grow in a variety of environments, although not on shallow soils lacking moisture or in swamps. - They are very tolerant of shade and are therefore often found in the understory waiting for release (the process by which understory grow into a newly formed space in the canopy when another tree dies or is removed). While in the understory, Sugar Maples are often fed on and injured by browsing deer.

![sug][sug]

##### Red Maple (Acer rubrum)

- Leaves: Red maple leaves have shallow, irregularly toothed lobes. They are smaller than sugar maple leaves and turn bright red in the fall.
- Bark: Scaly ridges that are loose at the edges.
- Identification Trick: If the leaves are changing, you'll be able to tell Red Maples by their color. If not, use the smaller leaves and red veins to identify this maple from others.

##### Mountain Maple (Acer spicatum)

- Leaves: Small, short-tipped, 3-lobed leaves
- The mountain maple is an understory tree (sometimes called a shrub), and it has a crooked and divided trunk. It grows along streams and on rocky hillsides.
- Identification Trick: There are 3 lobes on a Mountain Maple and they look more distinctly like mountains than other maples.

##### Striped Maple (Acer pensylvanicum)

- Leaves: Large with long, fine tips
- Bark: Gorgeous bark that has long, vertical stripes
- Habitat: The striped maple is also a "shrubby" understory tree, but it prefers northern slopes and valleys.
- Identification Trick: Stripped back is obvious.

![striped][striped]

##### White Ash (Fraxinus americana)

- Leaves: White ashes have compound leaves that grow in opposing pairs; that is, each "leaf " is comprised of one stalk with seven leaflets growing off of it. The leaflets are oval-shaped and taper to a point. They have infrequent, rounded teeth, and parallel veins. White ash leaves turn a bronze-purple in the autumn.
- Bark: Distinct, light gray bark furrowed in a regular diamond pattern
- White ash are common on upland soils, and often mixes with other broadleaf trees.
- Habitat: White Ash is an especially strong wood, but needs fertile and moist soil to grow. For this reason White Ash is rarely a dominant species in a forest. As understory, White Ash are shade tolerant, however, as their age increases, they become less tolerant of shade, making them prime candidates to be pioneer species of fertile abandoned fields.

![wa][wa]

##### Basswood (a.k.a. the American Linden) (Tilia americana)

- Leaves: Heart-shaped, pointed leaves with many sharp teeth and long stalks.
- Fruit/nuts: The flowers and fruit of the basswood grow in "pendants" that emerge from the bottom of leaf-life bracts on stalks. The fruit are round and nut-like.
- Bark: Basswood bark is "blocky"; it is a dark, gray-brown with narrow ridges divided into blocks. 
- Basswoods often grow alongside beeches and sugar maples on moist, north or east-facing slopes.

![bw][bw]

##### Birches (Genus Betula)

- There are many species of birch in the areas we hike in; the kinds you will find are dependent on the altitude, the age of the forest, and the water available. As a genus, however, birches are totally distinct:
- Bark: Birches have thin, peely bark w/ horizontally elongated lenticels. Birch bark makes wonderful toilet paper; be sure to take it from the ground though - never peel it from the tree!

##### White Birch (also called paper birch) (Betula papyrifera)

- Bark: White birch bark is creamy white and sheds in large thick sheets, revealing smooth reddish-orange bark beneath.

![wb][wb]

##### Mountain Paper Birch (Betula cordifolia)

- Bark: Mountain paper birch bark is white with a bronze tint and peels back in several thin sheets revealing a ragged surface underneath
- Habitat: Mountain paper birch is common to the areas we hike in, and can be found mostly in moist areas and higher elevations.

##### Yellow Birch (Betula alleghaniensis)

- Bark: Yellow birch has shiny yellow-gray bark with shreds that tightly curl at the ends. Yellow birch bark doesn't peel as easily as some others, and with age develops large, dark bronze ragged-edged plates.
- Leaves: Yellow birch leaves come out in pairs from short shoot off stem.
- Habitat: The yellow birch is the largest of the eastern birches; besides the White Pine, this is one of the few trees still found at heights of over 100 feet in present forests. It often has large roots on or above surface due to the fact that germination takes place above ground, on rotting logs.

##### Oaks (Genus Quercus)

- Leaves: Oaks have simple, alternate leaves with a distinct shape, multi-lobed along the mid-vein.
- Fruit/nuts: Acorns!
- Oaks are difficult to divide into species; they are better recognized by sub-Genus.

##### Red Oak Group

- Red oaks are common to the areas we hike in.
- Bark: Red oak bark is pale-gray, and grooved with shallow, dark furrows
- Leaves: Red oak leaves have pointed lobes separated by rounded notches
- Fruit/nuts: The red oak acorn is as wide as it is long, with a "beret-like" cup.

##### White Oak Group

- White oaks are not as common in the areas we hike in since they generally tend to grow further south.
- Leaves: White oak leaves have rounded lobes
- Bark: White oak bark is pale-gray, often red cast, and scaly with narrow ridges
- Fruit/nuts: White oaks have longish acorns with broader, "wartier" cups than red oaks.

#### New England Fun Facts

##### About Trees

- Baby pine trees can only sprout in the open sun, without other trees for competition
- Beech trees are one of the few species that can establish themselves beneath the canopy of other trees
- Many of the beech trees in New England are dying from an introduced fungal disease from China
- Chestnut trees no longer occur in New England in the wild
- The Striped Maple is fondly known as the ass-wipe Maple
- There are almost no forests in New England that have never been cut
- Much of New England's forests that could not be converted to farms were destroyed to create charcoal for industry
- Native Americans manipulated the forest New England using fire and created openings for crops
- Acorns are edible but only after the tannins are removed via soaking and cooking
- By the end of the year, all leaves on all trees have been partially eaten by insects
- The only part of the tree that grows in length are the tips (everywhere else they simply growing in circumference)
- Spruce, fir, hemlock, and pine are the only evergreen trees in the area
- Spruce and fir occur at high elevations or in primarily acid soils
- Ozone pollution is damaging the leaves of many upper elevation trees
- Overpopulation by deer has eliminated most of the understory and young trees from regional forests

##### About Other Plants

- All lichens are edible but taste like cardboard
- All lichens are a mix of an algae species and a fungus species in symbiosis
- Only a few species of mushrooms are edible, many poisonous mushrooms taste good
- Flower size, color, season of bloom, are designed to attract specific pollinators
- Maroon colored flowers are usually pollinated by flies
- Plants in the Mint family have stems that are square in cross-section
- Queen Anne's Lace is the same species as the carrot
- Grasses are pollinated by the wind
- The large woody mushroom that occurs on the trunk of many trees is called a conk
- Flowers occur only in spring in New England closed canopy forests 

### Fauna

With ten noisy first-years, it's not likely you'll see much more than squirrels, chipmunks and crows, but you never know. Wildlife is best found in the early mornings and at dusk, and most often near water where you might see moose, foxes, and white-tailed deer. These are easy to recognize; birds can be more difficult.

#### Common Birds

- Red-tailed Hawk: The most common hawk during most of the year. You'll see it mostly in open areas or power lines. A large bird-of-prey (raptor), with reddish undertail and white underwings.
- Turkey Vulture: Big, black, and wants your carrion. Also an open-space bird, it flies with a distinctive V shape and wings tilted upwards. Noticeable wobble in flight. Up close, it has an (ugly) bare head.
- Black-capped Chickadee: A common small bird that feeds in lower canopy, and nests in trunks. Look for small black and white birds with black caps flitting around understory, calling chick-a-DEE-DEE-DEE.
- White-breasted Nuthatch: Similar in size and behavior to chickadees, but this one will always be pointed down the tree, allowing it to get insects that other birds like woodpeckers might have missed in crevices.

#### Scat

- It's more likely that you will see traces of animals than the critters themselves: scat, tracks, or markings. Some suggestions of what to look for. Animal poop is distinctive!
- Owls regurgitate pellets of fur, bones, and other detritus, usually found near bases of trees.
- Black bears have human-looking droppings, oval logs of relatively constant diameter (greater than 1 inch).
- Deer vs. Moose: droppings will range from piles of small pellets to larger, less distinctly shaped masses, depending on diet and season. Moose droppings are much larger - if the clumps are bigger than about 1 inch, it's probably moose. (But if it's at high altitude, it's deer - moose do not frequent mountaintops.)

#### Tracks

- Deer vs. Moose: Both have heart-shaped, two-toed tracks. To differentiate, again go by size. Tracks around 4 inches for deer, vs. upwards of 6 inches for moose.
- Raccoons: Distinct, five-toed print. Whole foot, not just palm/toes; claw marks at end.
- Bear: you'll know it when you see it.

![tid][tid]

#### Other Marking

- Deer and moose eat the lower branches of trees in
the winter when snow coats the ground. Especially
at lake edges, look for this "high-lining" - trees
with uniform height of lower branches.
- Bears often scratch their claws across tree trunks,
strip lower bark for food, and claw open rotting
logs for insects; look for deep claw marks around
shoulder height, or torn-apart logs.

#### New England Fun Facts

##### About Bugs

- Of all our bees species only the Honeybee and bumblebees have queens, the rest are just single moms
- Honeybees are not native to this hemisphere
- There are over 300 species of native bees in New Hampshire and Maine
- Most native species of bees are solitary nesters
- If something comes out of the ground and stings you, you can be sure they are yellow jackets - a type of wasp, not bee
- Some species of yellow jackets nest in hollow trees not underground
- Wasps are carnivores and bees are vegetarians
- Yellow jackets, hornets, and paper wasps make their nests out of paper created from plant fibers
- There are no scorpions in New Hampshire and Maine, but there are pseudo-scorpions
- With only rare exceptions, all worms found in New England are not native to North America
- With rare exceptions, almost all terrestrial isopods (roly-polies - a.k.a. pill bugs - and wood lice) are not native to North America
- Mosquitoes are attracted to the CO2 exhaled when we breathe
- No millipedes are poisonous
- Some centipedes have a poisonous bite
- Spiders are not insects but arachnids

##### About Birds

- Most birds breeding in New England forests migrate south to the tropics for the winter
- The birds remaining in forests in the winter usually flock together in mixed species groups, these groups are often composed of groups of family members
- Blue Jays are very dependent on acorns in the fall and winter
- Barred Owls are the most common owl found in the New England woods
	- Barred owl calls sound like "who cooks for you, who cooks for you all"
- Sharpshinned and Cooper's Hawks are the most common hawks in forests and feed mostly on small birds
- Turkey vultures occur throughout the region eating dead deer and other carrion and are the only regional bird that can smell
- Birds descended from dinosaurs
- Birds primarily feed their young caterpillars in New England forests
- The yellow bellied sapsucker occurs commonly throughout all New England forests
	- The yellow bellied sapsucker drills lines of holes in the bark of trees and then returns to drink the sap and eat the bugs that come to the holes

##### About Reptiles

- The only poisonous snakes in New Hampshire and Maine are the timber rattlesnake and the copperhead
- The amount of poison that you would be exposed to, if bitten by a rattlesnake or copperhead depends on how long ago they ate
- Very small young copperheads and rattlesnakes can be as deadly as older ones as they often do not regulate the amount of poison they inject
- Box turtles can live to be over 100 years old

##### About Amphibians

- Soil living salamander do not have lungs but breath only through their skin, if they dry out they die
- Salamanders are 95% efficient at extracting energy from their food, humans are 5% efficient
- Red-backed salamanders can live to be over 25 years old

##### About Other Animals

- Red squirrels occur in conifers, gray squirrels occur in deciduous forests, and flying squirrels are only active at night and occur in both types of forests
- Flying squirrels often feed on many mushrooms that are poisonous to us
- Native red foxes have been eliminated in New England and replaced by European red foxes
- Gray foxes are common in forests, red foxes are common in fields
- Snails occur in more abundance and with more species in limestone areas than other substrates

### The Sky

Looking up at the clear night sky in the mountains often offers many more rewards than a typical evening in Boston. Given the opportunity, identifying stars and constellations can be a fun evening activity for you and your FOPpers. Put on a hat, grab a flashlight, head to a nearby clearing and look up!

#### Constellations

##### Ursa Major (Great Bear)

In Greek, the word for bear is arktos. And our term for the far northern latitudes where Ursa Major is seen for most of the year is the Arctic, literally meaning bearish. Ursa Major is most famous for being home to the Big Dipper. Try to find it! The bowl of the Big Dipper looks like a saddle on the Great Bear with the handle running up to form its nose. Look for three pairs of stars below the Dipper that are the Bear's paws.

![umaj][umaj]

##### Big Dipper

As it is one of the most recognized groups of stars in the sky, many people do not realize that the Big Dipper is not actually one of the 88 official constellations. Instead, it is considered an asterism, or group of stars. You can use the Big Dipper to help you find the Pole Star, Polaris. Draw a line through the two front stars of the bowl (the Pointer stars), and it will point to Polaris, the first significant star you come to.

##### Ursa Minor (Little Bear, Little Dipper)

Commonly recognized as the smaller of the Dippers, the Pole Star is the last star in the handle. The stars in Ursa Minor are fairly dim, but two bright stars form the front of the bowl. These stars are known as the Guardians because they always "march" around the Pole Star.

![umin][umin]

##### Cassiopeia

Another one that you might be familiar with, Cassiopeia has five bright stars forming a big "W" (or "M). You will find it right across the Pole Star from the Dippers. According to myth, Cassiopeia was an Ethiopian queen. Her husband King Cepheus joins her in the sky.

##### Cepheus

Fainter than his wife Cassiopeia, King Cepheus might be more challenging to find. Follow a line from the Pointer stars (in the Big Dipper) through the Pole Star and you will hit Cepheus' large triangular hat. Look for his squarish face beneath it and a little pigtail off to the side.

##### Cygnus the Swan

As you move across the sky, look for a large, bright cross(the Northern Cross) just beyond Cepheus. The long part of the cross forms the body of the swan while its wings extend from the other beam. You can find Deneb, one of the brightest stars in the sky, at the tail of the swan.

![swan][swan]

##### Lyra

Near Deneb (see Cygnus the Swan) is Vega, a brilliant, bluish white star. It forms a part of the small constellation Lyra. Supposedly it resembles a musical instrument. Can you guess which one?

##### Hercules

Keep moving in the same direction across the sky and you'll reach the famous Hercules. Large, but very faint, you might start off by trying to find his head, a trapezoid located midway between Vega (see Lyra) and another bright star Gemma (see the Northern Crown.) On a very clear night, if you're lucky, you may be able to find the Great Cluster of Hercules. Look for a faint, hazy star near the top left of his head. This hazy star is really a cluster of many thousands of stars, almost 35,000 light-years away.

![herc][herc]

##### Northern Crown

Small and simple, this constellation looks more like a tiara than a crown. The bright star Gemma appears at the center jewel in the tiara.

##### Bootes the Herdsman

A line connecting Gemma (see Northern Crown) and the end star in the handle of the Big Dipper (the Great Bear's nose) runs right through Bootes' head. Below the line is Arcturus, another bright star that is part of the triangle that forms his body. See if you can find his pipe as it extends up towards the Great Bear's nose.

##### Draco the Dragon

Look for a sweeping curve of faint stars between the Dippers. This will be Draco's tail. His head looks a bit like the bowl of a Dipper. Don't confuse its two fairly bright stars with the Guardians (see Ursa Major)!
