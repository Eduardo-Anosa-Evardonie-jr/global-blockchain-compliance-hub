The following is derived from the [NOLS Leadership Educator Notebook][pdf].

### Finding Your Leadership Style

1. Outline a long continuum line with two far ends defined thus:
	- Water: "I don't often voice strong opinions, particularly if I think it will cause hurt or be a waster of time. I put others before myself pretty consistently. I'm very flexible. You probably don't really know where I stand on issues, or what I think about you, unless you ask very directly. It's hard for me to state my own needs."
	- Wind: "I state my opinion and take stands easily. People know exactly what I think, feel, and want. I'm an open book and you don't even have to read the words because I tell them to you, especially if you try to cross one of my lines. Fight or flight? Let's get real - I stay right here and tell it like it is. I don't have a problem saying 'my way or the highway' if need be."
2. Place yourself anywhere on the continuum where *you* view *yourself*. The precise middle is out of bounds.
3. Without moving from your place in this left/right line, move yourself along a second, up and down continuum with the two far ends defined thus:
	- Cool cucumber: "I am calm and rational, and I do not get flustered about anything. I even have difficulty getting excited about things most people think are neat and exciting. My emotions are a glassy pond."
	- Hot tamale: "I tell people how I feel about everything. I cry at sad movies. My emotions are extremely active - the perfect storm."
Again, these refer to how you feel you are internally.
4. At this point, you will be in one of four quadrants, outlined below.

### Explanation of Leadership Styles

#### Architects & Analysts

Architects and analysts emphasize meaning and conceptual functions.

##### Pluses

- Information and opinion seekers
- Good at analysis and process observation
- Prefer to make decisions based on facts
- Prefer as much information as possible before deciding
- Can come out with totally off-the-wall solutions that work
- Translate feels and experiences into ideas

##### Deltas

- Can be slow in making decisions or dogged in facts
- Can happily leave most decisions to others and focus on only one decision
- Have to watch out for non-involvement or unrealistic ideas if they get into their own world

If a leader has this style, honor their need for information while also requesting they tell you how they will decide or delegate, and when.

##### Some Effects on the Group

Architects and analysts are often in the minority but their function is essential. If a group doesn't pay attention to this area, it will miss out on significant learning that comes from observation and analysis. The group may also be missing important process steps or other ways to view a situation. Too much of this style in a group may stall movement because the discussion, laissez-faire attitude and analysis allows opportunities to pass.

#### Drivers

Drivers emphasize action and directing.

##### Pluses

- Information and opinion givers
- Decision making is easy for them
- Often the keepers of the vision in a group
- Great at taking a stand, being direct, and making things happen
- Usually not too shaken by critical feedback

##### Deltas

- Often will urge "let's decide" as indecision can drive them crazy
- Will sometimes decide without input from others and step on toes
- Make mistakes when moving too quickly without adequate information
- Can come across as too impersonal and lose connection with their group
- Have to be careful not to "over-lead"

If a leader has this style, be as direct as possible when dealing with them. Bring problems and opinions to them: they expect this.

##### Some Effects on the Group

If a group does not have drivers, they must pick up driver functions or they can fail to meet far-reaching goals. Mature drivers are non-reactionary individual with much ability in the other quadrants, and they help ground a group. When this style is not mature, there may be too much individuality or structure. Turf battles or a lack of member autonomy and collaboration ensue.

#### Relationship Masters

Relationship masters emphasize caring.

##### Pluses

- Excellent at building and sustaining community
- Work well on a team
- Great at building rapport, consensus, and commitment and seeking feedback
- Support, praise, and feel concern
- Display high regard for others' wishes, viewpoints, and actions

##### Deltas

- May not take an unpopular stance if it puts a relationship at risk
- Can put so much emphasis on a relationship that tasks and decision-making fall behind
- Can forget or downplay their own needs, to their detriment

If a leader has this style, you may need to ask them to be more specific in outlining their expectation. Encourage critical feedback from them and tell them when you want to know what they think and want.

##### Some Effects on the Group

You cannot have too much caring and respect as part of your capacity - it is the glue that's essential for a group to function. As a leader, it is powerful when combined with other quadrant functions. If it is the only style a group has, the group may not take enough risks or make enough decisions to move forward significantly. The group may also avoid conflict to the extent that there is lack of depth in genuine connection and innovation.

#### Spontaneous Motivators

Spontaneous motivators emphasize emotional stimulation.

##### Pluses

- Often voice their ideas and supply passion to follow those ideas; energizers
- Great at motivating people as they possess a sense of mission or vision
- Good at energetic dialogues with other group members

##### Deltas

- Can be emotionally bound to their ideas; objectivity may be their biggest challenge
- Can create a highly emotionally charged climate if they put too much emphasis on challenging others and confronting assumptions

If a leader has this style, know your own position and don't be afraid to voice it. Ask them to give concrete examples to back up their viewpoints.

##### Some Effects on the Group

Spontaneous motivators are often light bulbs. Groups need this function to sparkle, create, prod, stir the pot, and impassion. A group without this style may be functional, but somewhat lackluster. When mature people with this style choose to be detached and monitor their emotional involvement, this is highly effective. If too much of this style is present in a leader, a group can be overly reactive or so impassioned about their ideals that they lose touch with other realities. Interestingly, many charismatic leaders and cult leaders come from this quadrant.
