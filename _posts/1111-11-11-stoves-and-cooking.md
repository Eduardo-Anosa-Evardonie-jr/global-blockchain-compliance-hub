### Stoves

#### General Stove Safety

(See also, Stoves/Fuel under Policies and Procedures.)

Who can use stoves?

- Stove use should always be supervised by a leader.
- No more than 2-3 people should be allowed in the cooking area - too many cooks knock over stoves.

Where are stoves to be used?

- No cooking on picnic tables.
- Fueling of stoves and storage of fuel bottles should take place at least 50 feet from the cooking area and any bodies of water.
- While on campus, stoves are to be used in designated areas only. These areas are: the Science Center overpass, the parking lot behind the FDO.

When in use:

- Never step over or near stoves - give them plenty of room. Make sure your FOPpers observe this as well.
- Never leave operating stoves unattended.

Troubleshooting:

- Never dissect stoves or open the fuel cap in the lighting area (danger of fuel spillage).

Lighting:

- Always stay on your feet when lighting a stove.
- Roll up your sleeves when lighting a stove.

Storage:

- Stoves should be carried upright and depressurized in packs, in separate compartments from food - ideally in different packs than the food to prevent fuel contamination.
- Fuel should be stored in a secure area during the winter months.

Remember, the stove causes burns so treat it appropriately. The stove fuel we use is white gas and it is flammable! Emphasize stove safety with your FOPpers so that you will never have to deal with the agony of burns.

#### How the Class FOP Peak 1 Stove Works

The stove consists of four main components: the Tank, Pump, Fuel Valve and Generator.

- The Tank (#8 in the diagram) is designed to hold both the fuel and air. To avoid a fuel leak during lighting, an adequate air space must exist above the fuel level in the tank.
- The Pump (#2 in the diagram) pressurizes the fuel tank. Opening the pump knob one turn allows air to be pumped past a check valve and into the air space above the fuel.
- The Fuel Valve Lever (#4 in the diagram; usually red in real life) controls the flow of fuel and air from the tank to the generator and controls the height of the flame. It can be CLOSED or OPEN and adjusted to control the intensity and efficiency of the flame. As soon as the stove lights, it is important that additional air be pumped into the tank to replace the air that is passing through the fuel valve.
- The Generator (#3 in the diagram) absorbs heat from the burner and vaporizes the liquid fuel passing through it.

A note on older stoves: Some of the stoves that FOP owns have an additional lever attached to the end of the generator. This is the flame adjustment mechanism. Moving the flame adjustment lever (black) from CLEAN to LIGHT/HI moves a needle in and out of a small orifice in the end of the generator. This needle both cleans the orifice and regulates the flow of fuel. Always light the stove with the flame adjustment lever in the LIGHT/HI position, so that the stove is delivering full heat output to the generator. To clean the generator orifice on these stoves, move the lever back and forth between LIGHT/HI and CLEAN. Otherwise, these stoves work the same way.

#### How to Work the Stove
In brief, ***SHLOP MOP***!

- Sleeves: make sure they're rolled up.
- Hair: make sure it's pulled back.
- Legs: unfold the stoves legs and place it on flat ground. Also, your own legs should be crouching.
- Open the pump knob.
- Pump a lot.
- Match. Or in most cases, lighter. This is a relatively self-explanatory device: just light it.
- Open the fuel lever and set the stove on fire.
- Pump it!

#### Detailed Operating Instructions

##### Filling the stove

Why? Make sure to fill the stove before each use. This will save you time by preventing your fuel from running out in the process of cooking, in which case you would need to wait until the stove is entirely cool before refueling. Never fuel a hot stove.

How? Open legs of stove and put it on a flat surface. Make sure the fuel lever is off and the pump knob is closed firmly. Remove the fuel cap (pointing away from you). Do not tilt stove while fueling. Pour fuel through funnel, filling the tank about 34 of the way (When looking in the fuel tank, the fuel should be just visible but no higher - DO NOT OVERFILL, this does not allow enough space for the fuel to vaporize, creating a hazard.) When you are done fueling, close the fuel cap on the stove. Close the fuel cap on the fuel bottle. Don't forget your fuel bottles in the morning!

##### Operating the stove

Where? Establish a cooking area well away from your camping area (never use stoves within 10 feet of tarps, sleeping bags, or packs). Look for non-flammable surroundings and make sure that the stove is on a smooth, LEVEL, stable surface before you light. Try to find protection from
the wind (but always maintain adequate ventilation and never surround a stove closely with wind-barriers (e.g. rocks) - the stove could explode if the fuel tank is overheated!).

Posture: Always stay on your feet while lighting/operating a stove. Roll up your sleeves when around stoves, tie back your hair and keep hanging clothing away from flame (remember! Synthetic anything is extremely flammable and will melt directly to your skin). Stoves may flare up when lit, so always keep your face away and be careful!

Pumping: You need to pump the stove to build up enough pressure to push out the gas before you light it. (a) Make sure the Red Fuel Lever is in the OFF position. (b) Open pump knob one turn. (c) With thumb over the hole on the pump knob, pump approximately 25 full strokes. (d) Close pump knob firmly - don't worry about taking your thumb off the pump as you push it back in; if you hear air escaping it's only the pressure from the last pump.

To Light: Light the lighter before turning on the gas and hold it at the burner, then turn the Red Fuel Lever all the way ON. As soon as the burner lights, open the Pump Knob one turn and pump for one full minute (about 60 pumps). Close Pump Knob. Adjust flame level as desired. Additional pumping may be required periodically. Save fuel by having the food ready to heat when you light the stove.

While Stove is Running: A leader should always supervise stove use and be responsible for monitoring the stove. Never operate stoves unattended! Keep billy can nearby. If the stove should flare up and/or burst into flames, smother it with the billy can, DO NOT use water to extinguish the flame (this will only help to spread the fire. Fuel is less dense than water and will rise to the top of it.). DO maintain cold water nearby in case of burns. Never step over or near stoves - give them plenty of room!

Turning off the Stove: Turn Red Lever to OFF. Wait for the stove to cool completely before storing it.

##### Packing a stove

Depressurize cooled stoves before packing (release fuel pressure by loosening the cap, but be sure to re-tighten it securely, making sure the Red ON/OFF valve is in the "OFF" position. Pack stoves upright and well away from (and below) food items to prevent potential contamination (fuel tastes nasty in food). Be sure the stove is protected so it won't get damaged or damage other items in the pack. Separate stoves and fuel between people (and canoes) when packing them, in case some- thing happens to the pack (or boat).

#### Troubleshooting and Repair

| Problem                                                                                         	| Solution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	|

| Clogged fuel line; flame doesn't burn hot enough. (Erratic, unbalanced, often yellowish flame.) 	| Try cleaning the generator. You will have to unscrew the nuts that attach the generator to the rest of the stove. Move wire cleaner back and forth in the generator (NEVER pull it all the way out). Blow through generator to check for airflow. Reattach, carefully re-hooking the wire. Pump more air into the tank. 	|
| If the stove leaks at the levers                                                                	| Tighten the packing nuts that hold the levers in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
| Yellow tongues of flame or flame voids mixed with blue flames.                                  	| Match heads or other foreign objects in or around the burner ring outlets. Make sure stove has cooled down and take apart stove and thoroughly clean the burner section.                                                                                                                                                  	|
| Loss of air pressure in operation.                                                              	| May be caused by several things including a poor gasket on the filler cap (replace cap), a leak in the pump assembly (other parts needed) or a leak in the upper port on the tank (other parts needed).                                                                                                                  	|
| Fuel spurts back out at you while you are pumping.                                              	| Take out the pump and pump air stem, and at the base of the pump well, you should see a flat-head screw pattern. Try tightening this with a flat-head screw driver.                                                                                                                                                      	|
| If the pump does not work                                                                       	| Remove the clip from the pump cap. Turn the pump counter clockwise several times to disengage the air stem; then pull out the whole pump assembly. Work several drops of oil or Vaseline (chapstick!) into the pump leather.                                                                           	|
| Flames blowing away from burner                                                                 	| Too much air pressure. Turn out the flame and reduce pressure through the filler cap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	|

#### Long-Term Stove Maintenance

Periodically check the tightness of the packings and if necessary,
tighten the packing nuts on the stove just enough to prevent leaks (about a 1/2 turn). Behind each nut is a packing or gasket material. However, DO NOT over-tighten, because the threads will strip.


Periodically squirt a few drops of oil into the hole on the pump cap. This will keep the pump functioning properly.

### Nutrition and Eating Concerns on FOP

Hiking, canoeing, and keeping warm in the woods all require lots of energy. We get this energy from the food we eat, so a balanced diet is really important on FOP. A typical day of hiking requires a minimum caloric intake of 2500 calories, and can require up to 4000 calories.

There are a variety of reasons that a FOPper (male or female) may not eat enough food while on a FOP trip. First, many FOPpers discover that they do not like FOP food. This is the first time many FOPpers are eating "camping food," and they may find they do not like the look or taste of the food we carry on FOP. Homesickness, nervousness, and discomfort in the outdoors can also contribute to a diminished appetite. Finally, a FOPper's unwillingness to eat FOP food may be indicative of a larger eating concern or eating disorder.

Common forms of disordered eating include binging, binging and purging (bulimia), and self-restrictive eating (anorexia). There are other forms of disordered eating as well. Both women AND men can engage in disordered eating habits. FOPpers with histories of disordered eating habits often put those habits on their med-forms; as such, you will rarely be going into a FOP trip "blind" about a FOPpers' concerns. Eating disorders and eating concerns have similar characteristics including:

- Self worth based on body image
- Over concern with body image, food intake, and/or exercise
- Low body weight
- Anxiety, uneasiness around food and mealtimes
- Secretiveness about food (wanting to eat at different times or alone)
- Fatigue 

It is important to remember that you, as a FOP leader, are in no way trained to diagnose, treat, or "cure" and eating disorder, and you ***should not*** try to do so while on FOP.

A FOPper's refusal to eat enough food on a FOP trip, for whatever reason, is cause for concern. Consequences of lack of food intake include:

- Fatigue (see above)
- Dehydration
- Cognitive impairment
- Diminished reflexes and lethargy
- Intolerance to cold

What to do if you are concerned about a FOPper's eating:

- You are NOT trained nor expected to cure the disorder in a week. You should not expect or feel responsible to do so. You do need to make it through the week safely by ensuring that all your FOPpers are eating adequately. Treat for and emphasize the short term. One person who is undernourished compromises their own safety and the safety of the whole group.
- Act right away! Don't wait till the next meal or day rolls around.
- Consult with the FOPper privately. If there is a problem, it will be a touchy subject. Don't be surprised if the person denies that they have a problem. 
- Use non-accusatory statements ("I'm worried about you..."; "I've noticed that..."")
- Don't try to label or diagnose their eating habits.
- Review the importance of eating on FOP.
- Food = energy
- Discuss short term solutions (breaking diet or habits for that week)
- Discuss possible substitutions to accommodate preferences.
- Do not compromise nutrition.

If the problem continues:

- Let the FOPper know that you want him or her to be able to complete the trip but that as a leader you must consider the well-being of the entire group. If s/he cannot eat to your satisfaction (see the nutrition section above for minimum eating requirements) s/he will endanger the group and will have to be evacuated.
- If an evacuation is necessary, make sure you think about how to present/address this issue with your group. Not eating enough on FOP endangers the safety of both the individual and the group and is grounds for an evacuation.

### Cooking

Eating well is a crucial part of any outdoor activity. If you are hungry, your FOPpers are probably hungrier. Take GORP breaks and check-in with the group to see how they are feeling. Hunger and low blood sugar can lead to irritability at best, accidents at worst.

So what exactly does one eat on FOP? This cooking section will give you an idea of typical FOP meals and some basic pointers to keep in mind. But remember that flexibility and creativity are key!

#### But How Do I Actually Cook?!

So you're in the woods, the stove is fired up at last, and you're ready
to impress your FOPpers with some good ol' home cooking, but you haven't a clue. Things to remember:

- Keep it simple. You are in the woods, not a Tuscan villa. A hearty meal that is edible, even if bland, is better that a gourmet-attempt-turned-scat. There is elegance in simplicity, and not all flavors are exotic creations. A grilled cheese and tomato soup at the right time can be just as "gourmet" as some sort of thing with braided goat cheese florettes.
- One major seasoning like curry or tex-mex is enough for each recipe. If people want to go crazy, hand the spice kit around as the meal is served. The complex blending of surprising blends of tastes from around the world is appropriate for chefs with years of training in yuppy California restaurants. On the trail, keep it simple and, ironically, you'll be called gourmet.
- A reasonable amount of that seasoning is better than an overwhelming amount. This is art, not football, so be delicate. If you think there's not enough, hand the spice kit around afterward. On the other hand, food needs seasoning to taste good. Consider proportion and the amount of food you're cooking: a teensy little pinch, mixed into a ginormous pot, will not result in much flavor per square inch.
- Soapy, bland food? Add salt. Not enough salt is the most common reason camp food tastes boring. Plenty of salt in with the vegetables and butter at the beginning of any recipe gets the vegetable juices flowing. Really, a hefty pinch is appropriate. On the trail, with limited cooking techniques enough salt can really add the flavor that makes a simple meal simple and not bland.
- Keep an eye on your vegetable rations. Fresh is better than rotten. Always.
- Be creative! Cooking doesn't have to be a chore on the way to eating; it can be an adventure in and of itself.

### Recipes

The following are a selection of FOP's most often-used recipes.

#### Fajitas

- If using dehydrated beans, it's a good idea to line the billy can with a plastic bag and mix the beans in that. Then you throw out the bag instead of cleaning the pot. - Add the taco seasoning to the beans.
- Another option is quesadillas: put a tortilla in the skillet, top with cheese, beans and veggies, and top with another tortilla. Fry until lightly golden, then flip. Done when the cheese is melted, so it helps to cut small or thin slices.
- Add sauteed peppers and onions and you have fajitas!
- Open the refried beans bag, put it in the billy can, and fold the top over the edge of the can to keep it open. You can pour the boiling water straight into the bag, our bags are special. They take a lot more water to rehydrate than you think. You can then tie the top of the bag, cut a hole in the bottom corner, and dispense the beans by squeezing them through the hole. Warning: if you use this method you will get comments on how much the beans look like poop.

#### Curried Couscous

- 2 part couscous, 3 parts water
- Bring water to boil. Add couscous and stir. Cover, remove from heat, add the curry powder, if you're going to, now - it makes it easier to stir it in evenly. Let sit for 5-10 minutes. Fluff and it's ready to serve...cool, huh?
- Meanwhile, back on the ranch: Stir fry veggies in margarine. Remember order (onions cook slower than carrots cook slower than broccoli) and sprinkle on a little water (just a few shakes now and then) as they cook. This atomizes the margarine and gives everything a nice flavor. Apples are a fun addition too! Glaze this mix by adding a little brown sugar toward the end.
- When the couscous is done, add the veggies, along with peanuts (enough so there are some in every serving) and raisins. Probably someone will complain about at least one of these ingredients. Oh well...problem FOPpers. Curry is not very spicy, so don't be afraid, add enough for a nice golden color. If there's any doubt, taste it as you go. Wait, however, to add black pepper. It gets very spicy if it cooks in.
- Another trick is breakfast couscous. Cook couscous according to the above recipe. However, add brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and powdered milk for a tasty sweet treat.
- Raisins and nuts add a lot of flavor, as well as a sauteed onion.
- Margarine adds some richness.
- Brown sugar can be tasty to.

#### Mac and Cheese

- You could probably make this one in your sleep...7-10 minutes to cook the pasta.
- Spices are good for making the dish more interesting: garlic, oregano, basil,
salt and pepper are all great but you might want to check with people or allow individual spicing.
- Adding real cheese, a few tablespoons of margarine, and some powdered milk (about a fistful size of milk with just enough water to make a thick liquid) can make the dish more authentic. Add it all at the end.
- Or, if you want, you can toss out the Kraft package and make the real thing: cook pasta, drain out almost all the water leaving a little bit at the bottom (like a 1/2 cup). Add about 1/2 cup margarine and 2-3 cups diced cheese, stir. Put 1/2 cup of powdered milk in a bowl and add just enough water to make a thick liquid, add it to pasta. Put back on the stove on low heat, stirring frequently, until the cheese is melted.
- Once the macs are done, do not drain all the hot water. Leave a little bit and add the cheese powder, and a bit of margarine. You may also want to add extra cheese, onion or garlic. Stir and watch it all goo. Mmmmm.
- Fried macs: once it's all done, fry it up in batches in the fry pan in margarine. Yum!

#### Spaghetti Dinner

- 4 parts water/ 1 part pasta
- Boil water with a pinch of salt. Add pasta and a dash of butter or oil to avoid sticking. When pasta is done (taste test! and look at the cross-section), drain quickly so it doesn't get soggy.
- Add choice of sauce: tomato sauce (tomato paste, a little brown sugar, salt, pepper, garlic, veggies), or gado-gado peanut sauce (peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, onion, garlic, crushed peanuts). Tomato sauce should be warmed up; gado-gado is best stirred up in a bowl and added to warm pasta.
- Fresh veggies (peppers, carrots, onions) taste really good in the sauce. Chop/dice them and sautee them in oil or margarine, then add tomato paste and water and other spices.
- Tomato paste from the can is bland and thick. Add water and a TON of spices: garlic, oregano, basil.
- Brown sugar, like 2-4 tablespoons, added to the sauce makes a huge difference.

#### Gado-Gado

- Pasta
- 1 cup vinegar
- 1 cup soy sauce
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 1 cup peanut butter
- Pinch of salt and onions if you want
- Make pasta. Heat all other ingredients together and then mix with
pasta... mm....mmm.

#### Quesadillas a la Orenstein

- Dice a pile of cheese
- Heat some margarine in the frying pan
- Place the tortilla in the frying pan, add a layer of cheese, garlic, oregano, and basil, then either fold the tortilla in half or add another tortilla on top. You can also sprinkle the spices on the outside. Cook until the bottoms are browned, flip and cook again until browned and cheese is melted.

#### Fruit Crisp

- Either bring extra dried fruit or use from GORP (apricots and cranberries are particularly good). Dice the fruit into small pieces. You basically want enough to make a layer of fruit in the fry pan.
- Put the fruit in the fry pan with some brown sugar (a few tablespoons), water (1/4-1/2 cup). Cook until the fruit gets soft and the liquid thickens. If it dries out before the fruit gets soft add some more water.
- In a bowl, mix together about 4 Tbs margarine, 3 Tbs brown sugar, a packet or two of oatmeal, some cinnamon (1 tsp), and some grape nuts (1/4 c). Mix with a spoon or your fingertips into a crumbly bowl of good stuff.
- Spread the topping over the fruit in the pan and cover the pan with the lid. Turn the heat on the stove down as low as it can go. Cook for a while, it helps if you can to hold the pan in the air above the flame. Basically you're looking to get heat trapped in the pan by the lid without overheating and burning the bottom. You'll never really get it completely crisp, you just want to melt the topping a bit.
- Warning: If you cook it a long time and the fruit burns a bit it'll taste really good but it will be really hard to clean the pan. To make the clean up easier later, you can do the initial cooking of the fruit in a separate pan (or scoop it into a bowl and wash out the pan) and then use margarine to grease the fry pan before adding the fruit and topping.

#### Extra Creamy Hot Chocolate

- Add margarine (and powdered milk) to make it taste richer and also more calories for cold days.

#### Scrambled Brownies

- Buy a package of brownie mix. Add water to make a thick liquid. In a fry pan put in a bunch of margarine (3-4 Tbs) and melt it. Add brownie batter to the pan let it cook for a minute or so then stir with spatula. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until it thickens to a consistency similar to scrambled eggs. Serve it up warm and gooey.

### After the Meal

All leftovers and scraps must be bagged and carried out, even leftover scraps of noodles and rice in pots and bowls. No food should ever be buried. Encourage FOPpers to eat every last bit during the meal, so that they get enough caloric intake and so that you're not faced with a pot full of leftovers which has gotten cold and unappealing.

Food scraps do attract animals. Be vigilant in maintaining a clean "kitchen" and avoid introducing power bars, peanut butter or some other item into the diet of the animals.

#### Sump Hole

When you make your sump hole, dig a six-inch pit and be sure to strain everything you pour into it. It's a good idea to turn your sump hole into a little hygiene station: make it home base for the trowel and the soap, too.

#### Cleaning Pots and Dishes

Be scrupulous about picking out as much food from pots as possible before rinsing. Never bring anything but a clean pot to the water. Dirty pots, pans, bowls, and cups should never go to the stream for cleaning or for rinsing. Instead, bring water for washing at least 200 yards away from the water source. Get out all the food bits, then scrub the pot. Then rinse with water and sump the water. Dump rinse water at least 200 yards away from the water supply, and strain it through a screen strainer. Soap can be used sparingly, primarily to cut grease on cookware. It is highly concentrated and a few drops will suffice for an entire pot inside and out. It is important, though, that you rinse thoroughly: associated risks of residual soap on cookware include diarrhea and other gastro-intestinal problems.

### Tips

- How to strain pasta (or try): Put the lid tightly on the pot and hold firmly. Let water out slowly while holding tight to the top with gloved hands. Or, poke holes in a plastic bag, and use it as a strainer. (be careful not to melt the bag).
- Leave a little extra water in the pasta when you strain, since everyone is dehydrated anyway. Soupy pasta is all right in the woods.
- Use water from pasta in hot chocolate.
- To make serving fair, let 2 FOPpers “own” each meal; they’ll be very equitable, and FOPpers won’t complain as much about the food.
- How to not lose your spoon: Don’t carry a loose spoon. Tie your spoon to your bowl. You may need to drill holes, and you may want to cover the know with duct tape so it doesn’t get gross. Leave about 12” of p-cord between the spoon and the bowl. You can use the string to hang your bowl and spoon from tarplines, from a tree near the kitchen, and basically get your stuff out of the way in camp. Also, you can cut your spoon down and keep it inside your bowl. Or, you can pack it with your toothbrush or pack it the pocket of the jacket you always wear.
- If you do lose your spoon: twig chopsticks! Can work excellent– take all the bark off the stick and clean the wood until it is shiny and you will wonder why you ever carried a spoon (until you eat a little of the bark or wood). If you get really desperate, a folded tupperware top works surprisingly well.
