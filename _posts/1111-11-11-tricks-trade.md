### Morning

- Assign two FOPpers to sing a wake up medley each morning.
- Hang your watch on your ridgeline under the tarp, so you will be able to hear the alarm in the morning. Otherwise the sleeping bag and clothing muffle the sound. Or, put you watch in your hat for a similar effect.
- If FOPpers won't wake up, you can take down the tarp from above them. Or, there's always a log roll.
- For a group who have a hard time getting going in the morning, get up before your FOPpers and take the bear bag down, so that right when they get up, their food is there and they can start packing immediately. Also, if you're feeling really generous, you can get up super early and make breakfast before your group wakes up, so that they have motivation to get right out of bed.

### On the Trail

- Put rubber gloves in a film canister on your backpack's shoulder strap to give quick access to gloves in an emergency.
- You can use personal tarps as extra raingear in lightening drills and big downpours.
- If you notice your FOPpers only hiking next to certain people, mix up the order by having them hike in order of birthdays, height, or something similar.

### Around Camp

- Bandanas help to mark off the rope attached to the tarp, both so that people don't trip over it and so that the tarp doesn't get messed up once you've set it up.
- Placing a bandana on each end of a tarpline next to the plastic will prevent rain water from riding the tarpline into the tarp.
- Put your Nalgene on the ground face down on top of your head lamp to create a lantern with perfect mood lighting for a group meeting.
- For dealing with bugs:
	- Put DEET on with the back of your hands.
	- Use Pyrethium on your clothes before you leave, it will stay on your clothing for 2-weeks.
	- Feed your friends candy, raising their body temp and attracting the bugs to them - human bug light.
	- Be extra careful to wash hands before doing food stuff...DEET is nasty, nasty stuff.

### Cooking

- How to strain pasta (or try):
	- Poke holes in a plastic bag, use it as a strainer. (be careful not to melt the bag).
	- Put the lid tightly on the pot and hold firmly. Let water out slowly while holding tight to the top with pot holders.
	- Use the stove bags as pot holders.
- Leave a little extra water in the pasta when you strain, since everyone is dehydrated anyway. Soupy pasta is all right in the woods.
- Use water from pasta in hot chocolate.
- Add iodine to the pasta water to turn it deep blue and impress your FOPpers (most likely but not necessarily drinkable, depending on how much you boil it and when you add the pasta).
- Put the mints from your candy bag in you hot chocolate for a gourmet treat.
- To make serving fair, let 2 FOPpers "own" each meal; they'll be very equitable, and FOPpers won't complain as much about the food.

### Nighttime

- Put your wet socks on your shoulders (or in your crotch) while you sleep and they'll be dry in the morning.
- Earplugs help on trips not to hear the alarm your co-leader has hung from the ridgeline and their snoring.
- If snoring is a problem, sometimes by matching breaths with the snorer, you will be able to be less bothered. When they exhale, you exhale, fooling your body into thinking you are snoring.
- Worried about the waterproofness of your tarp? Just double the tarps up, one on top of the other, and get cozy. Or, cut extra garbage bags along the sides - leave the bottoms, so it's one big rectangle of plastic - and lay the sheets of plastic over the ridgeline.)
- ***Do not*** put a plastic bag over a sleeping bag's bottom for extra waterproofing, it will collect condensation that's escaping from your sleeping bag, and you'll wake up with soaking wet feet.
- Keep one pair of socks in your sleeping bag and never take them out: your "bed socks". This way, no matter how wet, cold, or grungy your feet get during the day, you'll always have clean, dry warmth awaiting you in your sleeping bag. (This is especially helpful when hiking during the spring when you'll have wet feet and your feet need to get dry at night).
- You can put the bottom of your sleeping bag on your backpack to keep your feet of the ground.
- Brent's Curtain Method (BCM): enter your sleeping bag warm wearing a layer of polypro. Drop your poly bottoms to your ankles, but do not take off. Lift your shirt to your neck and roll-up sleeves, or just leave shirt around neck. When your body temp starts to drop through the night, pull the 'curtains' down: pull your poly tops and bottoms on, giving you the extra bit of warmth to sleep for another couple of hours.
- Another method of keeping warm is the Matissa Gasket (MG) which involves taking a fleece and clothes to wrap around your neck in your sleeping bag. Since heat in a sleeping bag often escapes through the hole in the top, the gasket plugs up the hole.
- Since staying on the ensolite pad is one of the best ways to keep warm, you can shape your ensolite to 'hold' your body on the pad by placing shoes under the ensolite sides to make the edges higher than the middle and stop the pad from sliding.
- Also, if you are sleeping on slanted ground, you can place shoes and boots at the bottom of your ensolite to keep it from sliding out from under the tarp.
- Clothing can act as padding to fill in spots, pad rocks, and try to make your bed more comfortable.
- If you are getting cold at night, make sure you go to bed warm. The sleeping bag only retains heat, so do calisthenics before getting in your sleeping bag or even push-ups or sit-ups once in your sleeping bag to warm up the bag.
- One rule to warmth is that the higher off the ground you are, the warmer you are, so do not be afraid to place layers of clothes on your ensolite to get you off the ground.
- If your feet are cold during the day, you can use vapor barriers socks (if you have dry socks and two plastic bags with no holes). Put on a pair of thin polypro socks, then a plastic bag over your foot, then a dry pair of thick socks. Your feet will get wet, but the plastic will prevent evaporation, keeping heat from escaping your foot and keeping insulating layers dry (boots and wool socks).
- If your sleeping bag is too long for you, the empty air at the bottom will make you colder (since you stay warm in a sleeping bag because your body warms the air, and so all that extra air to warm makes your body colder). Try stuffing some extra clothing down at the bottom to keep your toes warm.

### Processing and Group Dynamics

- Bring a few treats to celebrate reaching the top of a peak.
- Collect some fun goodies (some suggestions include food treats like candy, goofy things like little water squirting things or party hats, or memento to remind them of the trip. Remember to think of how many people are in your group and how the things will be divided) before your trip, put them in two plastic bags and wrap them up with duct tape. On the first night of the trip, present these mystery packages to your group. Explain that these are, respectively, the "high" and "low" packages, one to celebrate the best moment of the trip and one to improve the worst. It is up to the group to collectively decide when to open them. This gives the group some ownership over talking about how the trip is going, and gives them control of when they like a treat.
- Have a Black Tie dinner or evening. Tell your FOPpers that they need to assemble their most formal attire from the things that they have with them. You can leave it up to their imagination or give them hints (socks make great ties, trash bags and tarps make great skirts and dresses). This works especially well on the last night of the trip, so that your FOPpers are entertained while you're making the cheesecake.
- Taking everyone's watch can create a new experience of time awareness for your FOPpers, only eating when they're are hungry, sleeping when they're tired, etc. (Make sure that leaders keep watches.) Also, make sure this is a choice, not forced.
- Have your FOPpers write letters to themselves. You can do this at the beginning of the trip, and give them the notes back on the last day. Or, you can do it on the last day and send them the letters sometime during the year.
- Similar to writing letters to themselves, it's sometimes nice to give your FOPpers a chance to sit on their own. Especially towards the end of the week of spending all their time with the group, even just 30 minutes sitting and enjoying nature can be great reflection time.
- You can put Andes Mints (mountainous, delicious) on everyone's pillows the first night for a cutely hotel-ish treat to make the FOPpers feel welcomed and cared for (a Chris Angell special).
- Read the readings of the handbook. Encourage FOPpers to do it. Ask a FOPper to select a reading at each Chow Circle or to start the day to share with the group. The process of searching for a quote and sharing it has a positive front-loading effect on the group.
- Use a talking stick to facilitate discussion.

### Switch

- Trade wet shoes if basecamp is involved in your switch.
- Bring extra compactor bags
- Bring whistles
- Pray to Chapuchua

### General Logistical Hints

- Carry more durable trash compactor bags instead of regular trash bags to line your pack.
- Bring extra ziplock bags as all of your FOPpers will want them.
- Teabags apparently work to clean your face.
- How to not lose your spoon: Don't carry a loose spoon. Take a piece of P-cord and tie a knot on the spoon handle. Hold the p-cord so it the running end goes away from the spoon. Cover the knot with duct tape. Do the same to your bowl, try to tie p-cord around it the best you can and then add duct tape. Leave about 12" of p-cord between the spoon and the bowl. You can also drill a hole through the end of the spoon. This will work, although the string gets gross. You can use the string to hang your bowl and spoon from tarplines, from a tree near the kitchen, and basically get your stuff out of the way in camp. Also, you can cut your spoon down and keep it inside your bowl. Or, you can pack it with your toothbrush or pack it the pocket of the jacket you always wear.
- If you do lose your spoon: twig chopsticks! Can work excellent-- take all the bark off the stick and clean the wood until it is shiny and you will wonder why you ever carried a spoon (until you eat a little of the bark or wood). If you get really desperate, a folded tupperware top works surprisingly well.
