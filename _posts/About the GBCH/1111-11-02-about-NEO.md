[NEO](https://neo.org/) is a non-profit community-based blockchain project that utilizes blockchain technology and digital identity to digitize assets, automate the management of digital assets using smart contracts, and realize a "smart economy" enabled by a distributed network.

NEO was founded in 2014 and was real-time open source on GitHub in June 2015. Since its inception, the NEO team has experienced the blockchain industry boom and witnessed multiple cycles of digital currency markets. We believe technology drives progress and that together we can create the future. Motivated by this philosophy, NEO is working day in, day out to shift our traditional economy towards a new era of a "Smart Economy."
