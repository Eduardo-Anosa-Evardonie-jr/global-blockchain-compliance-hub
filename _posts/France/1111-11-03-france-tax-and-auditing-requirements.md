# Tax and Auditing Requirements

Tax liabilities for each type of entity will vary dramatically based on factors including: industry, business activities, eligible exemptions, etc. In all cases, you are advised to seek professional tax and auditing services for a comprehensive overview of your individual situation.

For more information on the French tax system, please refer to this [unofficial guide](https://www.impots.gouv.fr/portail/files/media/1_metier/5_international/french_tax_system.pdf) released by the Public Finances Directorate General (published 2016). 

## General Tax Information

Corporation tax is levied on all profits generated in France by companies and other legal entities. All EU countries except France tax worldwide profits. For foreign and French companies alike, only profits made in-country are subject to corporation tax. Conversely, companies may not claim tax deductions or exemptions for activities that do not take place in France.

## Cryptocurrency-Related Tax Information
The French Council of Estate recently ruled that cryptocurrency profits can be considered as capital gains from “movable property,” thus opening the door for treatment under a lower tax rate&mdash;from 45% to 19%. An additional 17.2% generalized social contribution tax would remain in effect.

## Compliance
Compliance requirements may differ depending on individual tax liabilities and incorporation type. For instance, per the French Commercial Code, SA/SAS entities must undergo a statutory audit, and appoint one to two auditors. Meanwhile, SAs, SARLs, and other incorporation types are required to publish annual financial data and submit two copies of their approved balance sheets to the local commercial court within 7 months of the end of the financial year. 

Generally speaking, all businesses must have an audit committee comprised of two thirds independent non-executive directors. The function of the committee is to:
- Review accounts to ensure the relevance and consistency of accounting methods
- Monitor the preparation of financial information
- Monitor the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems

## Non-profit Deductions and Exemptions
NPOs that satisfy certain conditions are eligible for exemption from certain taxes. 

### Qualification for Tax Exemption
Although requirements can look different for each incorporation type, generally speaking, NPOs that do not operate profit-making activities exceeding a certain profit margin, that do not have privileged relationships with individual companies, and whose activities do not directly compete with that of a for-profit company, are eligible for business tax exemptions. 

### Corporate Income Tax Rate for NPOs
Any profits made by NPOs are calculated at the standard corporate income tax rate of 33.3%. However, the effective rate can be higher for larger profit margins above a certain level. 

Income derived from assets (property, agriculture, certain types of investments) and not derived from for-profit business activities, may still be subject to corporate taxation. For certain types of investment income, the applicable rate ranges from 10% to 24%.

### Exemptions and Deductions for Giving and Receiving Donations
NPOs can accept donations, grants, or other contributions income tax-free. Value-added tax (“VAT”) exemptions are also provided for particular types of activities and assets, and a reduced VAT is applied for certain goods benefiting handicapped individuals. 

All foundations (except corporate foundations) are entitled to tax deductions for donations to other NPOs with general interest or public utility status--up to 0.5% of their annual income for donations. However, for most entities, contractual donations (which impose certain obligations upon the recipient) are subject to another tax.
