**Token sales in Gibraltar must...**

**Blockchain/Distributed Ledger Technology Providers** [1] 

* On 12 October 2017, the Government of Gibraltar released the draft regulations **[Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2017](http://gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/2017s204.pdf)** which will come into effect on 1 January 2018 and initial applications are already permitted by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission
  * These regulations make providing a distributed ledger technology services a **controlled activity** and provide grounds for **issuing a “DLT Provider’s license”** means a license granted under section 8 of the Principal Act to carry on the controlled activity of providing distributed ledger technology services
  * These regulations apply to the activities of firms, operating in or from Gibraltar, that use DLT to store or transmit value belonging to others, such as virtual currency exchanges [2]
  * These regulations focus on **nine core regulatory principles** which each licensee must adhere to:
    * A DLT Provider must conduct its business with honesty and integrity 
    * A DLT Provider must pay due regard to the interests and needs of each and all its customers and must communicate with them in a way that is fair, clear and not misleading
    * A DLT Provider must maintain adequate financial and non-financial resources
    * A DLT Provider must manage and control its business effectively, and conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence; including having proper regard to risks to its business and customers
    * A DLT Provider must have effective arrangements in place for the protection of customer assets and money when it is responsible for them
    * A DLT Provider must have effective corporate governance arrangements. 
    * A DLT Provider must ensure that all of its systems and security access protocols are maintained to appropriate high standards
    * A DLT Provider must have systems in place to prevent, detect and disclose financial crime risks such as money laundering and terrorist financing
    * A DLT Provider must be resilient and have contingency arrangements for the orderly and solvent wind down of its business
  * Notes on these regulations: 
    * Once these regulations are put into effect, Gibraltar would be among the few jurisdictions worldwide to offer a fully regulated framework for firms working with blockchain[3]
    * Gibraltar plans to provide more guidelines in early 2018 to attract ICOs [4]
  * Repercussions for operating without a license fines according to the [Financial Services Penalty Fees Regulations 1993](http://www.gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/1993s147.pdf) level 5. Further reprecussions have not yet been specified.

**Token Sales** [2]

* A September 22, 2017 statement from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) on September 2017 highlights the **lack of current regulation of token sales in Gibraltar**
* This statement also noted the new DLT regulatory framework introduced above and mentioned that Gibraltar is “considering a complementary regulatory framework covering the promotion and sale of tokens, aligned with the DLT framework” 
* As part of the same statement the GFSC issued a warning to people considering investing in tokens: “understand that tokens and ICOs are unregulated”
* Given the GFSC statements above, some Gibraltarian experts are of the view that it is entirely reasonable to expect that the current ‘[DLT Principles](http://gibraltarlaws.gov.gi/articles/2017s204.pdf)’ may be extended and applied to token promotion and sales activities

**Digital Proof**
* No specific laws related to Digital Proof were found
