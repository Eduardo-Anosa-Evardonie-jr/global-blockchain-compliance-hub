**Company registry requirements in Japan are....**

In Japan, there are firm legal distinctions between non-profit organizations or NGOs, and for-profit companies. For-profit companies come in two categories; the KK (kabushiki kaisha/株式会社) and the GK (godo kaisha/合同会社). Each and every one of the 15 organizations legally operating in the state of Japan as registered VCESPs (virtual currency exchange providers) are registered as KKs ([a list can be found here](http://www.fsa.go.jp/menkyo/menkyoj/kasoutuka.pdf)). This is due to the legislative requirements on virtual currency and ICOs under Japanese law pursuant to the VCA (virtual currency act). The KK should be seen as the primary, and (as of Jan 2 2018) *only* way to legitimately operate exchanges for virtual currency and initiate ICOs in Japan.

**For-profit companies - KK**
 
1. Find an office address.
* A representative director who is a legal resident in Japan and operates from the registered business address must be located in order to provide a bank account through which capital will initially be deposited.:
   * In the case of a Japanese branch of a foreign company, the 'representative director' role is called 'branch manager'.
