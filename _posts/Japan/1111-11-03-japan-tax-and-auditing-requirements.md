**Taxation requirements**

Adapted from [this source](https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/invest/setting_up/laws/section3/page3.html) by JETRO (the Japanese external trade organization). [This source](taxsummaries.pwc.com/ID/Japan-Corporate-Taxes-on-corporate-income) by PWC provides a more simple overview of the corporation taxation system in Japan.
Japan’s corporation taxes are composed of multiple components. These include corporate tax (national tax) local corporate tax (national tax) corporate inhabitant tax (local tax) enterprise tax (local tax) and special corporate tax (a national tax which is paid to local governments in tandem with enterprise tax). This set of taxes are collectively referred to as ‘corporation taxes’. Corporation taxes vary by income bracket for “Small and medium-sized enterprises” and are paid at a flat rate for “Enterprises” (not to be confused with GK/KK). The differentiating characteristics for enterprise sizes are described in the JETRO source above.  Here is a sample adapted from a JETRO graph showing corporation tax rates from April 1 2016 to March 31 2017.
