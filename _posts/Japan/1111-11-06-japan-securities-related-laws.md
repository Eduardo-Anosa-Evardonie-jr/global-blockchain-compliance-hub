The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission (SESC) exerts oversight on securities in Japan. While laws relating to the listing of tokens as securities can be presumed to be in development, there are no known extant regulations that specifically pertain to tokens or ICOs as securities. More information can be found on the SESC website [here](http://www.fsa.go.jp/sesc/english/index.htm), and they accept email enquiries delivered to the address listed [here](http://www.fsa.go.jp/sesc/english/contactus/contactus.htm).
