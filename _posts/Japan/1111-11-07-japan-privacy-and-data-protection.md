The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) requires business operators holding a personal information database consisting of more than 5,000 individuals identified by personal information on any day in the past 6 months to protect this information ([see here](https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/index.html?t=law&c=JP)).  This law was later amended to apply to all businesses in Japan. There is an option for business operators to disclose information to third parties, and the requirements for disclosure are clarified in the amendments.
