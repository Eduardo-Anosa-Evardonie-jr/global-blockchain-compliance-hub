## Securities-related laws (once a token is registered or identified as a security, what are the consequences for listing the token on crypto exchanges) [1] [2] 

For EU specific regulations, please visit [Europe: Securities Related Laws](https://neo-project.github.io/global-blockchain-compliance-hub//europe/europe-securities-related-laws.html).
 
In May 2018, the Portuguese Parliament debated cryptocurrency payment regulations, with the aim of adopting a new legal framework for cryptocurrency payment services. The new Portuguese regulatory framework is configured to apply "new rules for accessing payment accounts" in order to avoid unjustified setbacks and ensure that payments are secure. It will also introduce rules on operational risk management, while offering "reporting mechanisms" to service providers and ICO operators. While this is stated in several news sites, the official document and regulation has yet to be released, with an expected date this year.
