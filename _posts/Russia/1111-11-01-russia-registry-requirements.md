The procedures for establishing a legal entity in Russia are well-developed and are regulated by the Russian Federation Civil Code and by additional laws.

## Non-profit organisation

Non-profit organisation (NPO) — is an organisation, whose main goal of the activities isn’t to make a profit and that does not divide profits between the employees. Non-profit organisations can be created for social, charity, cultural, educational, scientific and government purposes. Non-profit organisations in Russia are associations, unions, institutions, non-profit partnerships, autonomous non-profit organisations, community-based organisations, consumers’ cooperatives, charities, and some other forms of organisations. According to the Russian legislation, all NPOs are divided into two groups: corporations and unitary organisations. Corporations are organisations whose employees have the right to fully participate in their activities and form a supreme governing body.

 
Organisations, whose founders do not become the participants and do not obtain the membership rights, are unitary organisations.
NPOs can have civil rights that correlate with the aims of the activities that are described in the company documents and can be responsible for these activities.

 
The activities of some of the NPO forms (all associations) are allowed without a state registration; however, in this case the organisation cannot obtain the legal entity status, it cannot own or on the basis of property law any separate property. Organisations can obtain property and non-property rights, perform duties (be a part of the civil turnover, conduct business activities), be a claimant and defendant in court only if they have the legal entity status.

 
Russian public associations are founded on their rules which must state the name and objectives, the structure and the type of public association, the conditions of becoming members or being withdrawn (only in case of the public associations with membership), the modality of appointing the boards and the board’s members, the procedure of amending the rules and other documents, the source of funds, the procedure of reorganization and liquidation.

The following documents must be registered no later than three months from the meeting where the decision of establishment was taken: 

- an application for registration of the Russian NGO
- the charter of the public association in three copies
- the minutes of the meeting where the decision of foundation was taken
- information regarding the founders
- the proof of payment of the registration fees 
- the details regarding the address of the governing body of the public association which is used for contacting.


All NPO must have an autonomous balance sheet, a bank account, be on the books of the tax and other public bodies of accounting and control (more info on Federal Tax Service Website).
