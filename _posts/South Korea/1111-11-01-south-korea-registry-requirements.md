## Non-profit/For-profit Company Registry Requirements

Registration of both for profit and not-for profit organizations requires the submission of numerous documents including articles of incorporation. Registration of for profit organizations is more streamlined and straightforward. There is no centralized system for registration of not-for profits and information on procedures for incorporation and registration are difficult to find.

### Not-For Profit Organizations 

In South Korea, not-for profit organizations can exist as unregistered organizations or an incorporated, registered non-profit (public-interest) corporations. Registration provides tax and other financial benefits. Freedom of association is guaranteed by Article 21 of the Korean constitution. 

Associations and foundations (public interest corporations) relating to art, charity, science, religion, social intercourse or otherwise not engaged in profit are considered juristic persons and are governed by the Civil Code. 

As set out in the Code, an association or foundation may be formed subject to permission of the competent authorities . 

Permission to incorporate must be obtained by drawing up articles of incorporation which detail the following: objective of the association; name; seat of office; provisions concerning assets; provisions concerning appointment and removal of directors; provisions concerning acquisition and loss of membership; cause of dissolution.  

Similarly, the founder of a foundation must endow property and draw the same articles of incorporation as an association.

If incorporation of the association or foundation is permitted by the appropriate governing authority, the incorporation must be registered at the seat of the organization’s principal office within three weeks from the date of permission. The following information must be registered: objective; name; office; date of permission of incorporation; causes of dissolution; total value of assets; method of effective contributions; and names and domicile of directors.  (No information was found with respect to fees for registration, registration timeframe or how to determine exactly who is the “competent authority”. The author assumes that in case of starting a Non-profit organization, a founder shall apply through the Ministry of Justice, with detail explanation of purpose and activities of the organisation.)
