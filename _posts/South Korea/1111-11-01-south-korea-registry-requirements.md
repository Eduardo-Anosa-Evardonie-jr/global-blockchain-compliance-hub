## Non-profit/For-profit Company Registry Requirements

Registration of both for profit and not-for profit organizations requires the submission of numerous documents including articles of incorporation. Registration of for profit organizations is more streamlined and straightforward. There is no centralized system for registration of not-for profits and information on procedures for incorporation and registration are difficult to find.

### Not-For Profit Organizations 

In South Korea, not-for profit organizations can exist as unregistered organizations or an incorporated, registered non-profit (public-interest) corporations. Registration provides tax and other financial benefits. Associations and foundations (public interest corporations) relating to art, charity, science, religion, social intercourse or otherwise not engaged in profit are considered juristic persons and are governed by the Civil Code. 

As set out in the Civil Code, an association or foundation may be formed subject to permission of the competent authorities . 
Permission to incorporate must be obtained by drawing up articles of incorporation which detail the following: objective of the association; name; seat of office; provisions concerning assets; provisions concerning appointment and removal of directors; provisions concerning acquisition and loss of membership; cause of dissolution.  

imilarly, the founder of a foundation must endow property and draw the same articles of incorporation as an association. 

If incorporation of the association or foundation is permitted by the appropriate governing authority, the incorporation must be registered at the seat of the organization’s principal office within three weeks from the date of permission. The following information must be registered: objective; name; office; date of permission of incorporation; causes of dissolution; total value of assets; method of effective contributions; and names and domicile of directors. No information was found with respect to fees for registration, registration timeframe or how to determine exactly who is the “competent authority”. Most likely, in case of starting a non-profit organization, a founder shall apply through the Ministry of Justice, with detail explanation of purpose and activities of the organisation.

### For-Profit Organizations  

There are three types of business forms available to foreign companies in South Korea: Foreign Branch, Liaison Office, and Foreign Owned Local Corporation. Each of these business forms has advantages and disadvantages, as well as differing scope of business activities, registration requirements and minimum capital requirements. In most cases it will depend on the degree of commitment a company has to South Korea and the planned business activity.

### Branch Office

A Branch Office is a form of business that generates profits in Korea, which is not locally incorporated and is not recognized as foreign direct investment. According to [InvestKorea](http://www.investkorea.org/en/foreigner/corporation.do), headquarters and their foreign branches are treated as a single legal entity (the same accounting & settlement). There is no limit in investment amount or ownership.

Branches do not require formal incorporation, making them easier in principle to set up than a local corporation, and with less registration fees. Unlike liaison offices, branches are also allowed to engage in sales activity. They are considered a separate legal entity providing some separation of debts and liabilities from their parent. Generally, branch offices are suitable for smaller scale operations.  Foreign companies can move on to a local subsidiary later as needed.

Required Documents generally include:

- Report form of the establishment of a foreign company’s domestic branch
-	Article of association (Notarization of the location of the headquarters is required)
-	A certified copy of registration or operation permission of headquarters
-	General principles of headquarters
-	Minutes of board of directors meeting that state the establishment of a branch or liaison office in Korea and the appointment of a Korean representative.
-	A certificate of permission for business
-	Power of attorney where the establishment of a domestic branch is commissioned to another person (Notarization of the location of the headquarters is required)

All documents from the home country need to be notarized, and provided with a Korean translated copy (the translator need not be certified).

General Requirements

1. To notify designated exchange bank.

A foreign company establishing a domestic branch must send a notification to the head of the designated foreign exchange bank (any Korean bank which handles foreign exchange). To get permission of establishing a financial business, the company must register at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.

2. Register with Court Registry Office

Once notification is confirmed by the exchange bank, the company must submit this to a local court registry office. In addition to the report/confirmation from the bank, the branch must nominate a representative who is responsible for day-to-day administration of the branch. The representative does not have to be a Korean resident.

3. Register at Tax Office for Business Registration Certificate
The branch must register at a tax office to obtain a business registration number. This process covers registering for tax such as sales and payroll tax. Foreign employees are required to pay Korean income taxes, which are generally withheld and paid by the employer. 
Every business engaged in supplying of goods or services, whether or not for profit is required to register for VAT purposes by applying for a business registration certificate. The forms can be downloaded from the national tax office’s website  and must be submitted to it, or to a district tax office.

4. Open Commercial Bank Account
Documentation such as identification documents would be required, and may require an initial deposit, as well as the business registration number. 

5. Establish an Office
It is not clear whether a branch is legally required to have a physical office in Korea. There appears to be no specific registration requirement of the office location with government authorities. It seems that there is no restriction on using a virtual office as a business address or similar services in Korea.

6. Register for Social Security Insurances
The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) collects contributions for all social insurance programs (National Pension, Health Insurance, Employment Insurance, and Industrial Accident Compensation Insurance).
Korea has a mandatory state pension service which is contributed to by both employer and employee. The national pension scheme is run by the National Pension Service (NPS). All Koreans and foreigners aged between 18 to 59 who live and work in South Korea must contribute to the national pension scheme. A company only needs to start contributing when it has 5 or more employees (otherwise, employees must individually manage their own contributions). Branches will be required by law to have some form of accident compensation insurance to cover any employees. The Korean Workers’ Compensation & Welfare Service states all workplaces subject to the declaration of WCI/EI relations shall submit a Declaration of WCI/EI Relations within 14 day after having started business. An employer must report employment information including worker’s name, resident registration number, address, employment date, employment termination date, average monthly wages, etc. using “relevant declaration forms”; the reported information will be used to assess and bill relevant (insurance) premiums. The employer must enroll and declare employees to the system. The following documents must submitted to the [NHIS](http://www.nhis.or.kr/static/html/wbd/g/a/wbdga0602.html), via post or in person at one of the [offices](http://www.nhic.or.kr/english/about/about04_5.html):
-	Employee Health Insurance Application Form
-	Copy of the business registration

7. File Rules of Employment
If a company has 10 or more employees in Korea its working conditions need to be documented in a “Rule of Employment” and this has to be filed with the Ministry of Labor and Employment. Either one “Rule of Employment” or different “Rules of Employment” can be created, split by working type or occupation type.
