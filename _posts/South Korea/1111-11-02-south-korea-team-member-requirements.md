A foreigner may stay in Korea within the scope of his/her sojourn status and sojourn period. 

## Starting a business:

A **Foreign Owned Local Corporation** is recognized as a "foreign investment" under the Foreign Investment Promotion Act in South Korea. An individual seeking to invest in South Korea should have one of the following:
- a D-8 (Corporate Investment) visa, a D-9 (Trade) 
- an F-5 (permanent residence) visa 
- an F-6 (marriage immigration) visa 
According to the Foreign Investment Promotion Act, at least KRW 100 million must be invested to get a D-8 visa.
