Foreigners must register their office/investment with the local tax office.  Given language issues, the complexity of Korean tax laws, and the potential for misunderstanding, companies are recommended to hire a local accounting firm to file taxes. 

Information about Korean taxes can be found at National Tax Service website. 
Simple description of the Korean Tax System:  

A company's tax year is its accounting period as specified in the articles of incorporation, which normally is a 12-month period. The tax year cannot exceed 12 months. Financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and statement of appropriation of retained earnings) and a business report must be filed each accounting year.

Listed companies and unlisted financial institutions are required to adopt K-IFRS (Korea-International Financial Reporting Standards). Unlisted companies may choose either K-IFRS or Korean Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (K-GAAP) for financial accounting. Certain provisions of the tax laws (e.g. depreciation, foreign currency translations) have been amended to reflect the adoption of K-IFRS .
