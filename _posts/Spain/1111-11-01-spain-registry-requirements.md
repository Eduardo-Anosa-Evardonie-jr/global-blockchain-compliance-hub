# Non-profit/For-profit Company REgistry Requirements

## Non-Profits

Spain has three common types of non-profit entities: associations, foundations, and cooperatives. Please note that Catalonia, Basque County, Valencia, and other autonomous zones may have their own legal framework. 

### Associations
Associations are the simplest and most flexible entity type. Any three people (or legal persons) can *“make a written agreement in which they undertake to contribute their knowledge, experience, resources and services to the attainment of the objective of the association, as well as approve the Articles of Association governing its administration.”* This document can be made public or kept private. 
To declare a new association, founders must submit:
- Association formation minutes (“Minutes”) *(notarized)*
  - Names, nationalities of the founders of the association (whether natural or legal persons)
  - Name of the association (as well as any official abbreviation/acronym)
  - Address of association
  - Nationality of association
  - Expression of willingness of founders to form the association
  - Specific agreements made between founders
  - Reference to and Incorporation of the Articles of Association
  - Date and place of the signing of the Minutes 
  - Designations of members for provisional governing bodies or counsels within the association framework
  - **If establishment is done by a legal person(s), the adoption of the formation agreement must be accompanied by certification from relevant authorities.**
  - **If establishment is done by natural persons, or individual representatives, their personal identities must be certified.**
- Articles of Association *(notarized)*
  - Purpose and activities of the association
  - Address of the association (already established in the Articles of Association; foreign associations must establish a branch in Spain)
- Requirements (and accompanying forms) for admission, withdrawal, and termination
  - Criteria to guarantee the democratic administration of the association
  - Admission form
  - Must state any members or associates that receive compensation for their services

Once forms are complete, the founders must register with the Registry of Associations. Foreign associations as well as associations that carry out activities in more than one “Autonomous Community” must register with the National Registry of Associations. Other information may be requested as well. 
If profit-making (read: commercial) activities are involved, it may also be necessary to register with the Mercantile Registry, which handles registrations of all entities and persons engaging in commercial activities in Spain. 
 
### Foundations
Foundations are formed when some amount of capital, property, or other assets is irrevocably committed toward serving the general interest. In Spain, the “general interest” may include, but is not limited to: 
“social matters, education, culture, sports, health care, cooperation for development, environment, scientific research or volunteer work or any other public benefit purpose (open clause).” 
Individuals and and legal entities may establish a foundation. A least 70% of annual income must be used for the public benefit purposes of the foundation. Foundations also may not pursue a private purpose, such as providing benefits to founders’ immediate family. 
To establish a foundation, founders must have:
- Starting capital of at least 30,000 euros (typically) 
- Founding document
- Either *inter vivos* (notary deed) or *causa mortis* (will)
- Name and address of founder
- Founder purpose
- Foundation purpose
- Description of foundation assets
- Statutes
- Composition of foundation board

To register, first go to the Protectorate for approval of the foundation’s purpose, its activities, and the sufficiency of the endowment (at least 30,000 euros). If approved, you may then proceed to the notary to establish the foundation. The notary will establish the foundation and register it with the Foundations Registry under the Ministry of Justice. 

### Cooperatives
Cooperatives are worker-owned entities identified by their democratic governance and joint ownership. There are many types of cooperative (over a dozen), including worker cooperatives, farming cooperatives, housing cooperatives, etc. Cooperatives may be set up for both nonprofit and for-profit causes. 
Cooperatives may offer certain types of benefits to members, including tax deductions, reductions on contributions to social security, etc.
