# Tax and Auditing Requirements

The following section is written for your general edification. The tax situation for each type of entity will vary dramatically based on factors including: industry, business activities, eligible exemptions, etc. In all cases, you are advised to seek professional tax and auditing services for a comprehensive overview of your individual situation.

For further guidance on navigating the Spanish tax regime, visit the [website](http://www.agenciatributaria.es/AEAT.internet/en_gb/Inicio/_Segmentos_/Empresas_y_profesionales/Empresarios_individuales_y_profesionales/Empresarios_individuales_y_profesionales.shtml) of the Agencia Estatal de Administración Tributaria, Spain’s main tax authority. 

## General Tax Information

(The following is an excerpt from Deloitte’s [2017 guide](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Tax/dttl-tax-spainguide-2017.pdf) to Spanish taxation.)			
						
‘Taxes are levied in Spain at the national level (either by the central government or the regions) and at the municipal level (by the municipal authorities). The main national taxes are the corporate income tax (“CIT”), branch profits tax and value added tax (“VAT”). Other taxes include capital duty, stamp duty, transfer tax, real property tax and miscellaneous taxes levied by the local governments.
						
Spain offers a special tax regime for Spanish holding companies (“ETVEs”).
						
VAT does not apply in the Canary Islands; instead a specific sales tax (“IGIC”) is levied. The Canary Islands also levy their own fuel and tobacco special tax.
						
Some specific rules may apply in the Basque Country and Navarra Region.
						
Spain has implemented the EU directives, including the parent-subsidiary, interest and royalties and merger directives. Spain also had implemented the savings directive, which required the exchange of information between tax administrations when interest payments were made in one EU member state to an individual resident in another member state...
						
National taxes are administered by the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness, and its regional equivalents…		
						
In principle, all Spanish entities with separate legal status (i.e. corporations, limited liability companies and most partnerships) and foreign corporate entities are liable for Spanish CIT. Spanish resident companies are subject to CIT on worldwide profits and capital gains. A nonresident company is subject to CIT only on Spanish-source income and gains, subject to the provisions of an applicable tax treaty.
						
The basic 25% corporate tax rate applies to the worldwide profits of resident corporations.
						
Trading profits and other income arising through a Spanish PE of a nonresident entity also are subject to tax at the full corporate rate. An additional tax at a rate of 19% is imposed on income remitted to a foreign head office (with some exceptions, discussed under 4.4, below). Income of a nonresident entity not connected with a PE generally is taxed at lower rates via withholding at source.
						
Special tax rates apply to certain companies, such as collective investment institutions, including real estate investment funds (1%), certain cooperatives (20%) and entities involved in hydrocarbon research and exploitation and credit institutions (30%). Special regimes exist for Spanish REITS (“SOCIMIS”), Spanish economic interest groupings and EEIGs, “temporary business associations,” venture capital companies and funds and industrial and regional development companies…’

Meanwhile, cooperatives are taxed under a special tax regime established by the Cooperative Tax Regime Law of 20/1990. Ordinary profits are taxed at 25%, although some unique instances may call for a higher tax rate of 30%. Cooperatives also receive certain tax exemptions. Please refer to a tax professional for further guidance on your individual situation.
