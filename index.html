  <h2>Congratulations!</h2>
  <p>You found it!</p>
  <p>The Harvard First-Year Outdoor Program Leader Handbook is designed to help you learn what you need to know to lead a well-managed, interesting, all-around-great FOP trip. It will serve as a resource for you during training and on your trips.</p>
  <p>The great John Muir once said, "Thousands of tired, nerve shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home: that wilderness is a necessity; that mountain parks are reservations useful not only as foundations of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life." In this spirit, the FOP Steering Committee presents to you the comprehensive guide to bringing a group of incoming first-years home. "But wait," you may be asking, "aren't they moving away from home?" Ha ha, young grasshopper, you are just beginning to understand this grand mystery.</p>
  <p>This FOP Leader Handbook is the accumulation of the past thirty years of FOP wisdom, and while you pause to consider the contributions of countless leaders of years past, we're just going to go ahead and thank them. So to all the nameless souls who worked so hard to put together this handbook: thanks, team. We started with a great product, and we recognize that our contribution is only a small piece of the result.</p>
  <p>Consider this the grandest of welcomings to FOP - the collective knowledge of thirty years of leaders. We recommend - nay, insist - that you read it, and read it well. Use this resource wisely. Use it for the good of humanity. Or at the very least use it for the good of eight to twelve incoming first-years. After all, John Muir once said, "one touch of nature makes the whole world kin."</p>
  <p>In the spirit of adventure and with all of our support and love,</p>
  <p>Grace, Jordan, Wren, Jason, Lili, Susannah, Chris & Coz</p>
  <p>FOP Steering Committee 2014</p>
