<div class="col-md-9">
  <h2>Welcome!</h2>
  <p>You've come to NEO's Global Blockchain Compliance Hub, an ongoing project aimed at compiling a public Github database </p>
  <p>that includes legal details related to blockchain and cryptocurrency for as many jurisdictions as possible worldwide. </p>
  <p>We're hoping  this can become a community-driven community resource that will help folks interested  in starting their own </p> 
  <p>NEO-based blockchain projects think about regulation as they move towards the point where they'd need to actually seek counsel. </p>
  <p>We're undertaking this project because NEO is committed to compliant and sustainable growth, and we believe this sort of resoource </p>
  <p>is currently lacking. </p>
  <p>If you're interested in contributing (by either updating a country page or creating a new one), please let us know - we're always </p>
  <p>looking for new partners. You can reach out to milesgraham@neo.org. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For each jurisdiction, we aim to answer the following information: </p>
  <p>1. Non-profit/for-profit company registry requirements</p>
  <p>2. Team member nationality requirements</p>
  <p>3. Tax & auditing requirements</p>
  <p>4. Governing laws/bylaw requirements</p>
  <p>5. Laws related to token sales, blockchain, and digital proof </p>
  <p>6. Securities-related laws </p>
  <p>7. Privacy & data protection-related laws </p>
  <p>8. Who bears final responsibility/liability in case something goes wrong?</p>
  <p>9. What is a smart contract and is it legally binding?</p>
  <p>10. How is dispute resolution integrated? </p>
  <p>11. Can smart contracts be nullified? </p>
  <p>12. Suggested readings</p>
